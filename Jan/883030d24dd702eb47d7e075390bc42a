"This was not a coup. This was an attack by a terrorist group backed by some powers that I would not name.""The names of military and civilian individuals are starting to be put on the table" at the feared National Intelligence Agency," the source said. "I'm afraid that innocent people are going to be caught up through denunciations."&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
