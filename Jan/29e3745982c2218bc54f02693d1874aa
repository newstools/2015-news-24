Johannesburg - All charges against Lieutenant Colonel Stephan van Zyl and Lieutenant Colonel Christine Anderson have been withdrawn, the SA National Defence Union said on Tuesday. "The military prosecuting authorities have today informed the attorneys of indicted Air Force officers in the 'Guptagate' matter, that all charges are forthwith withdrawn and, therefore, no prosecution will commence against them," national secretary Pikkie Greeff said in a statement. Anderson and Van Zyl were accused of being involved in the landing of a private jet carrying guests to a wedding for wealthy business family the Guptas, at the Waterkloof Air Force base in Tshwane. "Sandu confirms that both officers have already provided instructions to the Sandu legal team to immediately institute civil law suits against all the state organs which were involved in implicating them." The legal team had earlier on Tuesday "demanded" that Van Zyl be reinstated. The SA National Defence Force was not immediately available for comment.
