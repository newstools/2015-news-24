Harare – Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe returned home yesterday and immediately fired a salvo at former governing Zanu-PF administration chief Didymus Mutasa for seeking external intervention to resolve the party’s internal problems. Mugabe, whose long absence from home had started to fuel speculation about his alleged health problems, told thousands of supporters at Harare International Airport that Mutasa was a “stupid fool” to think that Southern African Development Community leaders could interfere in Zanu-PF’s internal squabbles. “A stupid fool cannot be corrected but Zanu-PF issues cannot be taken overseas. We don’t entertain outside interference,” Mugabe said. Mutasa said this week that he had written to SADC leaders seeking their intervention to have the outcome of last month’s Zanu-PF elective congress reversed. He has also threatened to take the party to court seeking the same relief. Mutasa is one of several senior Zanu-PF officials, including former vice president Joice Mujuru, who were fired from government last month amid allegations that they had plotted to assassinate Mugabe. They deny the allegations. Mutasa was until last month Zimbabwe’s presidential affairs minister in charge of the state security apparatus. Meanwhile, Mugabe said his wife was recuperating after undergoing appendicitis surgery while on vacation in an unnamed Far East country. He said Grace Mugabe had her appendix removed a few days ago and was recovering out of hospital after being discharged this week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
