You have certificated people and educated people. You can have many degrees but also in that you need brain," Motsoeneng told the newspaper.SpeechHe was clarifying what he meant in a speech he delivered at the announcement of the matric results on Monday, where he reportedly said: "Because if you have paper and you don't have brain you can forget [sic]."He said he was trying to explain that a qualification was not enough."You can have all the qualifications, but if you can't operate in the studio, for example, how can you work?" he was quoted as saying."I qualified myself.
