Johannesburg - Two Polokwane policemen have been arrested for allegedly soliciting bribes from Zimbabweans, Limpopo police said on Sunday. They were arrested on Thursday after allegedly demanding payment from Zimbabwean citizens who were travelling into South Africa by bus, said Colonel Ronel Otto. "It is alleged that they entered the bus and demanded passports from the passengers," said Otto. The officers allegedly told the passengers that some of their passports were invalid and demanded that everyone on board pay R100 before they could resume their journey. "While they were busy collecting money, some of the passengers attacked the policemen and they took a belt, shirt and name tag of one of the [policemen]," said Otto. The policemen then fled. The bus driver drove to a local police station and reported the incident. "While there, the two members also arrived. They were pointed out by the passengers in the bus and were arrested," said Otto. The two are due to appear in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court on Monday on corruption charges.
