They were not asked to plead at the time.The State alleges that in July, Plaaitjies informed a woman accused in a number of criminal matters that he had spoken to Fasser, the investigating officer in the cases, and that "something" could be done to help her.Plaaitjies allegedly arranged for the accused to meet himself and Fasser, but on the undertaking that she would not report what was discussed.At the meeting, Fasser said her case was serious, and that she stood to lose her house and money. Fasser told her he was able to help her for R10 000, which she paid.All communication with Fasser had to be via Plaaitjies.At a second meeting, Fasser allegedly told her the dockets of her cases were to be shredded, but that two other officials involved wanted a cut of R20 000 each. She agreed, but instead went to a senior police officer.Permission was given for an undercover police operation during which the money was allegedly paid, and Plaaitjies and Fasser arrested.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
