An 18-year-old has been arrested for allegedly raping two little girls in Butterworth, Eastern Cape.The girls were sent by their parents to fetch change from a spaza shop on Wednesday at the Eugene informal settlement in Butterworth, said police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha today. The allegation is that the suspect closed the door of the spaza shop and raped them, he said. When the kids were released and went home, they broke the silence and told their parents. The girls are aged nine and 10.The case was only reported to the police yesterday, said Manatha. The cause for the delay for reporting the case is still not clear. Once the case was reported to the police, members rushed to the home of the suspect and arrested him. The teenager was expected to appear in the Butterworth Magistrates Court on Tuesday on charges of rape.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
