Chelsea Pieterse A MAN’S body was found tightly wedged between two rocks in the ­Umgeni River near Howick’s Mills Falls yesterday morning. As crowds gathered on the slippery rocks on the river under the scorching sun, police combed the scene for clues. Community members, armed with sticks, meanwhile chased away hungry fish from the body. A trail of blood could be seen leading from a path along the rocks to where the body had eventually fallen.  As the victim was equipped with boots and cycling gloves, police speculated that he might have been a burglar who had used the river as a ­getaway path. Police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket had been opened at Howick police station and the matter would be investigated. “It is suspected that he was involved in a housebreaking case in the area,” he said. It was believed that the man may have been injured before trying to cross the river, slipped and fell in the water.  Members of the victim’s family at the scene refused to be named or speak to the press. Yesterday’s incident occurred two weeks after a body was found at the ­bottom of Howick Falls. The body of the 20-year-old man was later identified as a person who had been reported missing by his family a week earlier.  His death was suspected to have been a suicide.  • chelsea.pieterse@witness.co.za 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
