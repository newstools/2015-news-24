	     Bloemfontein - A Welkom domestic worker has been arrested after she was caught on video allegedly beating her employers' 7-month-old baby boy, Netwerk24 reported on Monday. Lieutenant-Colonel Thando Mbambo said the worker Mafsehediso Lisbeth Makashea appeared in the Welkom Magistrate's Court, in the Free State, on 23 December and was released on R1 000 bail. She would appear again on 29 January. The child's mother told the newspaper she went shopping with her 6-year-old child on 21 December, and she set up a camera in her living room where Makashea was left to look after the baby. She reportedly said she previously had a bad experience with a former domestic worker and wanted to see for her own peace of mind how Makashea treated her children when she was not at home. The video reportedly showed Makashea slapping the baby while he was crying, shoving his head on the floor and pulling him up by his shirt. Charges were then laid against the worker. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
