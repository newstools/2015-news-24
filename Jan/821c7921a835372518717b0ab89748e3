Otherwise we risk endorsing jurisdictions unworthy of a democracy," said Diagne, adding that "the legal profession cannot practise before the CREI"."Everyone has the right to speak, except the defence" in the trial, Cire Cledor Ly, another of Wade's lawyers, told reporters.But prosecution lawyer Yerim Thiam said Wade's counsel was expelled on Wednesday because he was "blocking" the work of the court.The younger Wade was an extremely divisive figure in Senegalese politics in the run-up to the presidential election in March 2012, with many believing his father was trying to line him up as a successor.He was often criticised for alleged mismanagement of public finances and was nicknamed "super minister", and "the minister of the Earth and the sky", after his father placed him in charge of the international cooperation, air transport, infrastructure and energy portfolios. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
