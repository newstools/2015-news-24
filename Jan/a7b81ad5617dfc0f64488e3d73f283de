"The Congolese are simply jealous," said a woman selling bread from beneath an umbrella, shaking her head in dismay. "It's a pity."A Chinese diplomat, who requested anonymity, told AFP the apparent targeting of Chinese businesses by rioters were isolated instances as part of wider unrest, and of no long-term significance.Because of that, the diplomat said, no specific security instructions to nationals had been issued by the embassy, which insists there is no "plot against Chinese" citizens in DRC. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
