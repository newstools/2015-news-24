Johannesburg - The Johannesburg metro police on Saturday said two officers who were caught on CCTV video footage allegedly taking a bribe in Westdene have been removed from their usual duties."A formal complaint has been laid and the officers involved have been taken out of uniform and transferred to do administrative duties," spokesperson&nbsp; Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said.He said a "due disciplinary process" would follow. "JMPD does not tolerate corruption," said Minnaar.In a video posted on Youtube and which is time-stamped for New Years Day, a black VW Golf is seen being followed by a clearly marked metro police car. Watch the video here. Once the Golf stops, two metro police officers get out of their vehicle, followed by a driver and passenger from the Golf also stepping out of their car. One officer appears to check the licence disc of the Golf.However, the officers and two men from the car then appear to chat together before the cops return to their vehicle, followed by the other men. It appears a bribe is seemingly handed over before both cars depart.Frikkie Botes who posted the video to Youtube, also posted a comment saying a formal complaint was made on Friday.Minnaar urged the public to report any corrupt activity involving metro officials: "Anyone who comes across a corrupt metro office or gets asked for a bribe must report the incident immediately to the JMPD 24 hour anti-corruption hotline on 0800-203712." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
