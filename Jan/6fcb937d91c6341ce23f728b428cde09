The party did not respond."Part of the details solicited was whether or not Mr Babuile, has appealed the matter and relevant details thereto, as well as to ascertain his status and eligibility to occupy a seat in the legislature," Chaane said."This would have assisted the legislature to take an informed decision and to act on the matter in terms of its rules and procedures."Dantjie sent another letter on 26 January requesting clarity.She also indicated that failure to respond within five days would result in Babuile's salary being suspended and processes being initiated to terminate his membership from the legislature.The Citizen on Tuesday reported that Babuile had been running the EFF's North West affairs from his prison cell. He was jailed last year for 12 years for the murder of David Chika, regional secretary of the ANC.The newspaper said it had been reliably informed that Babuile, whose annual package is over R1m, received his December and January salaries while in jail. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
