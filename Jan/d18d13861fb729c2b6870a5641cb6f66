JohannesburgÂ  - The Limpopo health department has disputed a report that found equipment shortages and theft taking place at provincial hospitals and clinics, City Press reported on Sunday. Department spokesperson Macks Lesufi disagreed with the findings of a Public Services Commission report suggesting that at least one patient died every weekend at Lephalale's Ellisras Hospital due to there not being enough ventilators for car crash victims. "To our knowledge, our ventilator at Ellisras Hospital in the theatre... is fully functional," he told the newspaper. Lesufi said, therefore, that the "assumption" that patients died due to problems with ventilators was "wrong". The report also found that staff at Messina Hospital were stealing Cytotec - a drug used in abortions or to induce labour - and selling it on to a third party. At the same hospital, the report - compiled after both scheduled and impromptu site visits that took place in April last year - found that mentally ill patients were being handcuffed due to a lack of sedatives. Lesufi said any theft of medicines would have been picked up by the central dispatch centre. "Despite the fact that there had not been any indication of any unusual activity at Messina Hospital, this allegation will be investigated."
