A 72-hour sit-in will follow.Western Cape premier Helen Zille appointed a commission of inquiry into policing in Khayelitsha in August 2012, following a multitude of complaints about policing and vigilantism.The 500-page report concluded that there were serious inefficiencies in policing in the area and a breakdown of trust between the community and police.The organisations criticised National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega for apparently classifying what seemed to be her interim response to the findings.&ldquo;For this to be classified - we are still not sure of the reason," Notywala said. Phiyega was not really concerned "with their dignity", he added.He said the last thing they wanted was a blame game between the parties.&ldquo;We were hoping that by this time they would all be sitting at one table to discuss and work on these recommendations.&rdquo;Police spokesperson Lieutenant-General Solomon Makgale said Nhleko acted and directed the police to engage Zille on the matter. He said Phiyega would arrange a follow-up meeting with the premier.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
