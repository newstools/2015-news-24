He was really sick,&rdquo; a law enforcement insider was quoted as saying.When it became clear that he had been poisoned, suspicions fell on his wives. Most fingers pointed in the direction of MaNtuli.City Press editor Ferial Haffajee could not immediately be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
