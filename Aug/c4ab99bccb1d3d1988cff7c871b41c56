The motive for the killing is unknown," he said. &nbsp;"A case of murder was opened at Highflats SAPS for investigation and no arrests have been made," he added.KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural Union spokesperson Koos Marais said the killing was a serious "cause for concern".He said the incident was the latest in a string of deadly farm attacks in the province, and the farmers had to place their trust in the police's handling of the investigation."All we can do is appeal to the SAPS to do everything in their power to make an arrest as soon as possible, and then hopefully that will serve to set the minds of the farmers in the area at ease."More visible police, patrols needed - unionMarais said farmers had become a soft target - being so far removed from emergency responders like police."We once again reiterate our call to the police for more security measures to be implemented, mainly more visible policing and patrols in the rural areas."We also ask that all our farmers maintain a high level of vigilance on their plots, and that they exercise due caution,&rdquo; Marais said.A report released by the South African Human Rights Commission last Thursday, said there had been 33 farm murders in 148 attacks so far this year, but suggested they were not racially motivated.Their findings included that law enforcement agencies should step up their efforts to combat "crimes against farming communities" and that the police should regularly update the SAHRC on crime affecting those communities.According to the report, it was apparent from numerous submissions that the Department of Justice was not fulfilling its role towards the farming community. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
