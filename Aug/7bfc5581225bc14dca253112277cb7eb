Its head, Babacar Gaye, was dismissed from his post last week amid a series of allegations of sexual abuse and excessive use of force by peacekeepers.The mission of more than 10 000 uniformed personnel was first authorised in Central African Republic in April 2014 to curb fighting between the mostly Muslim Seleka rebels who had seized power in 2013 and the anti-balaka Christian militias.According to UN rules, the troop contributing country has 10 days to decide if it intends to investigate the allegations itself or leave the investigation to the United Nations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
