Freedom of the press does not mean you work against the country," Kiir was reported telling journalists.Earlier this month, two newspapers said the government has stopped their operations in an apparent crackdown on the independent media over.Moi was shot dead in the Jebel area of the capital, Juba. Otieno Ogeda, chief executive officer of Corporate Weekly, said the media house had not received threats over recent articles Moi wrote, including two that focused on the scaling back of operations of South Sudan's only brewery. The body was found near the brewery, but Moi also lived in the same area.Nothing was stolen from Moi during the attack, Ogeda said."Everything was intact, even the money in his pocket was never stolen, even his phone was not taken away," he said.Moi is the seventh journalist to be killed in South Sudan this year.In December 2013, troops loyal to Kiir clashed with those loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar. Machar signed a peace deal on Monday to end the continued fighting while Kiir has promised to sign in coming days.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
