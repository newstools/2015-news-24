The list published on Tuesday includes firms from Russia, the US, Nigeria, South Africa and Australia. Uganda's first oil licensing round is being closely watched by transparency watchdogs and environmental activists who hope the oil blocks will eventually go to firms with strong social and environmental track records so that the country may minimise the mismanagement and corruption seen in other oil-producing countries in Africa. The territory in the Albertine Graben region in western Uganda is an ecologically sensitive area, and one of the blocks on offer lies within a wildlife park. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
