It also imposes hefty fines for "false" media reports on militant attacks.Rights groups, which have accused Sisi of imposing a repressive regime, fear the new law could be used to further muzzle dissent and target critics.The passing of the law was expedited after state prosecutor Hisham Barakat was assassinated in a car bombing in June, followed by a large-scale jihadist attack in the Sinai Peninsula days later.The judiciary and security forces already had wide-ranging powers in tackling "terrorism", and Sisi's regime has been accused of using the battle against jihadists as a pretext for crushing dissent.The law "increases authorities' power to impose heavy sentences, including the death penalty, for crimes under a definition of terrorism that is so broadly worded it could encompass civil disobedience," Human Rights Watch said Wednesday.But the foreign ministry hit back at these criticisms, insisting that other countries should "respect the independence of the [Egyptian] judiciary".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
