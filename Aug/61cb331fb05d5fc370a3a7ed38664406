He was arrested on another murder case while still on bail for allegedly killing his wife Fatima in April.Patel, a Polokwane businessman, will be back in court on August 11. He was arrested last week Friday for the murder of Tony Adams, who was killed in 2013.The state prosecutor, Madelein Roelofse, said that new evidence had emerged that directly linked Patel to the murder of Adams.Adams was beaten to death with a hockey stick after he allegedly broke into Patel&rsquo;s house. His body was found in the parking lot of a supermarket in the area.Just moments after sitting through Julius Malema&rsquo;s trial that never got to start, the Economic Freedom Fighters president&rsquo;s instructing lawyer, Tumi Mokoena, moved to another court room to represent Patel.Mokoena told the court that Patel&rsquo;s brother was initially arrested for the murder but the case was later withdrawn due to insufficient evidence.The state had asked for a seven-day postponement in order to gather sufficient information to make their case but the defence argued that they had abused the process by arresting Patel on a Friday.The magistrate, Ndivhuwo Mungane, reprimanded the state for arresting Patel without having gathered all of the information necessary to make their case.Roelofse emphasised that new information had come to light. This, she said, prompted their request for the postponement.Patel was visibly upset by the later date designated to his hearing as a result of the congested court diary. He will remain in detention until next week Tuesday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
