He said the peacekeeping force in Central African Republic has faced 57 allegations of possible misconduct, including 11 cases of possible sexual abuse, since the mission was established in April 2014 to calm deadly violence between Muslims and Christians. Ban appointed Gaye in July.Dujarric said he did not know how many peacekeepers are involved in the 57 allegations.Gaye did not respond to requests for comment. His resignation letter, seen by The Associated Press, says the issue "could be a systemic problem warranting consideration at the highest level of the organisation."Gaye's letter also said he had taken a "very robust stand" against misconduct and that his mission had repatriated "many" peacekeepers for misconduct. The spokesperson for the mission, Hamadoun Toure, told the AP that at least six were sent home last month alone.The firing comes a day after Amnesty International accused U.N. peacekeepers in Central African Republic's capital of indiscriminately killing a 16-year-old boy and his father and raping a 12-year-old girl in separate incidents this month.That follows allegations that UN peacekeepers had sexually abused street children in Bangui and a separate allegation of child sexual abuse against a peacekeeper in the eastern part of the country.Powers of criminal investigationIn an email Wednesday, the legal director of Medecins Sans Frontieres, Francoise Bouchet-Saulnier, said that "since September 2014, MSF has treated a total of four minors who reported sexual abuse by the UN peacekeeping forces in three separate cases" in Central African Republic. Bouchet-Saulnier said the case included the 12-year-old girl.The UN mission in Central African Republic is also being investigated over how it handled child sexual abuse allegations against French troops last year, in which children as young as 9 said they had traded sex for food.In a statement, the US-based advocacy group AIDS-Free World blasted what it called the "monumental failure of leadership and appalling mismanagement" at the UN headquarters.Ban in the past has expressed his interest in starting to "name and shame" the countries whose peacekeepers are accused of misconduct, though calling out countries has its risks. The UN has no standing army and relies on member states to contribute troops and police for its missions."I want member states to know that I cannot do this alone," Ban said on Wednesday. "They have the ultimate responsibility to hold individual uniformed personnel to account."The UN has no powers of criminal investigation or prosecution, leaving it up to peacekeepers' home countries &mdash; which the UN officials often don't name publicly. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
