She urged other women to speak out when they end up being abused."When I arrived in Oman, I didn't know what was going on, but I ended up being a sex slave. My male employer and his grown-up relatives used me as they pleased," Ali told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Ali said she was forced to work for 18 hours a day on domestic chores and caring for her employer's elderly parent. When she asked for her salary her boss refused to pay her and her passport and mobile telephone were confiscated."They considered me a prostitute so I was kept in servant quarters away from the main house," said Ali, who left after a neighbour notified Tanzanian embassy officials of her situation.Tanzania's 2008 Anti-Trafficking in Person Act outlaws all trafficking with punishments of one to 10 years in jail, a fine of 1-30 million Tanzanian shillings, or both.Critics, however, say these penalties are not commensurate with other serious crimes and not an adequate deterrent.Said Kilufya, whose B&amp;B Agency is one of those suspended, protested the government move, saying they were not consulted."I don't think it is fair to ban organisations which are operating legally without giving them a chance to defend themselves for the alleged offences," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
