She was ordered to leave the homestead in February this year.&ldquo;Her husband, Mr Jacob Zuma, did not [personally] instruct her to leave the homestead.&rdquo;He said Ntuli-Zuma had offered her &ldquo;full co-operation pertaining to the alleged investigation into this matter&rdquo;.Earlier this month, City Press and News24 reported that Ntuli-Zuma and various accomplices were on the radar of authorities.Soon afterwards, Roux issued a statement on behalf of Ntuli-Zuma in which he said she had denied involvement in, or knowledge of, any plot to poison her husband."Our client has not 'crumbled and confessed' to having any knowledge of any plot to poison her husband," Roux was quoted as saying in a News24 article at the time. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
