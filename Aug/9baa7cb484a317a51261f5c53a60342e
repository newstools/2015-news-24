Amanda Khoza, News24(File, Durban 2022) Multimedia &nbsp; &nbsp; User Galleries &nbsp; &nbsp; News in Pictures Send us your pictures &nbsp; &nbsp; Send us your stories Durban &ndash; The DA in KwaZulu-Natal has labelled a recommendation for a multi-party delegation to travel to New Zealand for the Commonwealth Games Host City announcement, as wasteful expenditure.DA caucus leader Zwakele Mncwango said the trip was nothing but an excuse for &ldquo;councillors to go on holiday&rdquo;.&ldquo;Why should the entire executive be going when only the mayor should be going? We voted against the recommendation because it is not in the interest of ratepayers.&rdquo;The request, which was tabled at a full council meeting at Maphephetheni on Wednesday, sought the approval for a delegation of six executive members and four officials to travel to Auckland, New Zealand from August 30 to September 4. The trip will cost the municipality R300 518.The document states that head of tourism Phillip Sithole will represent city manager Sbu Sithole and that flights, accommodation and travel costs for the delegation will be paid for by the city.The costs for the mayor and the deputy city manager of emergency services will be paid for by the Commonwealth Bid Committee.The six members of the executive committee include deputy mayor Nomvuzo Shabalala, ANC councillor Nondumiso Cele, Zandile Gumede and Fawzia Peer, NFP councillor Bongiwe Mtshali and the IFP&rsquo;s Mdu Nkosi.&ldquo;The city has not even engaged the residents on how this [Commonwealth Games] is going to impact them.&rdquo;IFP exco member Mdu Nkosi said he was surprised by the DA&rsquo;s decision not to support the recommendation. &ldquo;We have already done the groundwork. Canada withdrew and it is obvious we are going to host the Games. It would be pointless not to go for the announcement.&ldquo;I think Zwakele is crying foul because he is not part of the delegation going to New Zealand,&rdquo; said Nkosi.NFP councillor Bongiwe Mtshali agreed with Nkosi. &ldquo;This is going to benefit our economy and small businesses in Durban.&rdquo;eThekwini mayor James Nxumalo was not immediately available to comment.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
