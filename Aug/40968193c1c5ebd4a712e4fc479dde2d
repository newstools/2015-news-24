Watch. WATCH Johannesburg - The credibility of the Rugby World Cup could be damaged because of the South African government’s insistence on quotas, the FF Plus warned on Monday. "We would ideally like to see pressure being applied on the South African government to cease any future political interference in rugby and kindly request your assistance herein," the party said in a memorandum handed to the British High Commission. It was delivered following questions about the Springbok rugby team chosen to contest the Rugby World Cup starting in England and Wales on September 18. Coach Heyneke Meyer selected nine black players for his squad, announced on Friday. With this the South African Rugby Union’s (Saru) 30% target for representivity had been achieved. The FF Plus said political interference in the selection of the national rugby team could mean South Africa's strongest available team would not compete in the tournament. "This interference also places unnecessary pressure on the black players in the Springbok team selected on merit as they may also now be viewed as mere quota players." Meanwhile, Tshidiso Mokhoanatse, leader of the relatively unknown Agency for New Agenda, would take the minister of sport and Saru to court on Wednesday over the team’s selection. He wants to stop the Springboks from leaving the country, arguing the team was not representative of the population and its selection was done in violation of the values enshrined in the Constitution. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
