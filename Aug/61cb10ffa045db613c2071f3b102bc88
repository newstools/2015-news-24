The NPA’s Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said Shepard’s application for leave to appeal was granted and his bail of R5 000 was extended. “We are satisfied with the sentence. It shows that foreign nationals are entitled to the same protection by the courts and the Constitution as South Africans,” said Ramkisson-Kara. News24 reported earlier that Williams was kicked to death at the Kings Park Rugby Stadium on March 23 2013 after a match between the Sharks and the Melbourne Rebels. Shephard - with three other people - was initially accused of murdering Williams. The charges against Andries van der Merwe, Dustin van Wyk and Shepard's older brother Kyle were dropped in December. It was reported that a fifth person, Grant Cramer, was initially charged with assault, but turned State witness.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
