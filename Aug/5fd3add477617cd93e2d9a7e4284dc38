Amnesty International says the verdicts "are an affront to justice that sound the death knell for freedom of expression in Egypt ". "The fact that two of these journalists are now facing time in jail following two grossly unfair trials, makes a mockery of justice in Egypt ," says the group's Middle East and North Africa director Philip Luther. "For those who didn't already know, this grossly unfair trial shows the blatant disregard for media freedom in Egypt , where the limits are overstepped every day," Reporters Without Borders secretary general Christophe Deloire says.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
