They hacked off her horn while she was alive,&rdquo; said an upset Dedekind.&ldquo;We found her on Wednesday morning and got a helicopter and vet in immediately.&ldquo;She was sedated by the vet and treated on site, and then loaded and transported to a holding location.&ldquo;The bullet entered the side of her head, missed the brain, but damaged her spine. It is lodged on the other side of her neck.&ldquo;However, trying to remove it would probably do more damage.&ldquo;She has a small chance of surviving, but will need numerous intensive treatments and a cast will have to be made and fixed to her snout to cover her wound to help her not to keep opening up the injury.&rdquo;Dedekind said a similar incident had occurred in March this year, when a pregnant cow and calf were shot and their horns hacked off.&ldquo;The calf died but the cow survived,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I want people to realise that we have to act now to save the rhino.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
