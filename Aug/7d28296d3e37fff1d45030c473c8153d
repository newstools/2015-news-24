Not only was she incorrectly referred to as "sir", even though she presented herself as a woman, she was also told by an official that her medical reports did not have a stamp from her doctor.Officials then asked her four times in front of other members of the public about her gender change, an experience Van Zyl described as humiliating.But Khoza told Van Zyl that he couldn&rsquo;t believe she was refused help and said the medical reports she submitted had all the necessary information.She also told Khoza she was willing to speak to the department&rsquo;s staff to help them better understand trans persons."We&rsquo;re human. We&rsquo;re not a threat," she said."This [application for ID gender change] doesn&rsquo;t mean my battle is over but it's a hurdle I just stepped over."- What's your experience with Home Affairs been like?
