	     Durban - One person died and three others were  injured when a wall collapsed at a Newcastle construction site on Thursday.  ER24 spokesperson Chitra Bodasing said medics arrived and found four workers hurt at the site.  “The wall had fallen outwards, towards a vacant piece of land, onto the workers. A man found lying between some rubble was assessed. Unfortunately, there was nothing paramedics could do for him. He was declared dead,” she said.  “Three others were assessed and found to have sustained minor to moderate injuries. They were treated and transported to hospital for further medical care." Bodasing said the cause of the collapse was unknown. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
