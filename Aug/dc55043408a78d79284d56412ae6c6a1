The 18-year-old victim was stabbed in the chest outside Oaklands High School in Lansdowne at about 22:00 on Friday, Western Cape police spokesperson Constable Noloyiso Rwexana reported. The school was hosting a fundraiser at the time of the incident. “The victim died from his injuries and a case of murder has been opened,” she said. Community Policing Forum chairperson Hanif Loonat, who had been at the scene along with local neighbourhood watches, said the victim and another man had been involved in a scuffle allegedly over a cap. “The murdered teenager had refused to hand it over to the guy who was hassling him for it,” he said. “After he was stabbed, he came running towards us before he collapsed. He died at the scene.” The suspect, who Loonat said was identified as a 20-year-old Grade 11 pupil, was arrested after he returned to the scene and was identified by witnesses, he added. The suspect is expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
