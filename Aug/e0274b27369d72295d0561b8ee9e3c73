At AngloGold Ashanti mines, for which the union has the best information, this premium amounts to three hours&rsquo; overtime a week, bringing the normal 45 hours&rsquo; work up to the mines&rsquo; traditional 48-hour week, says Amcu.&nbsp; According to the union&rsquo;s consulting economist, Dick Forslund, this &ldquo;premium&rdquo; is really a way to hide the fact that the mines pay only three hours&rsquo; overtime a week when in reality mine workers generally clock 10 hours more than the legal definition of &ldquo;normal hours&rdquo;.&nbsp; According to the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, every hour above normal hours should be paid at 1.5 times the normal rate.&nbsp; Using an average of 10 hours as the presumed overtime per worker each week, this led Amcu to conclude that the mines have underpaid overtime of about R10&thinsp;billion under the wage deal signed in 2013.&nbsp; The chamber issued two short statements, one rejecting Amcu&rsquo;s claims as &ldquo;spurious&rdquo; and the other announcing it would now revert to a lower earlier offer as the talks go to the CCMA.&nbsp; Responding to City Press&rsquo; questions, the chamber disputed almost all Amcu&rsquo;s overtime arguments and criticised its &ldquo;reckless promises to employees&rdquo;.&nbsp; There was no risk premium and workers got paid their &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; overtime every month, said chamber spokesperson Memory Johnson.&nbsp; Paul Stewart, a sociologist at the University of the Witwatersrand who wrote his PhD thesis on labour time in South Africa&rsquo;s gold mines, says working hours have been just as important as wages in the industry&rsquo;s fractious, century-long history.&nbsp; Local gold mines have clung to the 48-hour working week for decades. Since the 1970s, this has mostly taken the form of the &ldquo;11-shift fortnight&rdquo; &ndash; a worker works six days one week, then five days the next, with everyone taking Sundays off.&nbsp; The Chamber of Mines last month resurrected the old call for fulco (full calendar operations) and conops (continuous operations) mining &ndash; meaning 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.&nbsp; The chamber has maintained its shift systems by applying to the minister of labour for so-called variations on the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.&nbsp; In its 2013 application, the chamber said the system could not run on less than five hours&rsquo; overtime a week. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
