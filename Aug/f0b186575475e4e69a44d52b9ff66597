Sars spokesperson Luther Lebelo said the erectile dysfunction tablets, which were discovered on Monday, had an estimated street value of R6m. "[The Viagra was] imported without the requisite regulatory control and was therefore liable for seizure." Last month, hard work by the customs officials led to the seizure of 40 000 Viagra tablets at the same mail centre. The boxes containing those tablets were sent from Hong Kong, and were declared as plastic toys. Lebelo said at the time that customs officials profile packages in the centre during their inspections to determine which are suspicious.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
