Then the plane flew us back to Ouagadougou," he said.Haba said authorities in Ghana and Ivory Coast were complicit with Guinea in preventing free movement by a citizen of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) within the boundaries of the bloc and this was illegal."They are preventing him from returning until September when the deadline expires for candidates to hand in their election papers," he said.A senior security source in Ghana said that under an Ecowas protocol, Camara was not supposed to leave Burkina Faso and was thereby prevented from landing in Ivory Coast. Accra-bound passengers were allowed to disembark in Ghana, the source added.Meanwhile, a government source in Guinea, which is Africa's top producer of bauxite, confirmed that the plane did not land, but denied any responsibility. There was no immediate comment from authorities in Ivory Coast.Assassination attemptSecurity forces in Guinea used tear gas to disperse hundreds of Camara's supporters who had gathered at the airport to welcome him home, witnesses said.Guinean authorities in July indicted Camara over a massacre and rapes at a stadium in the capital in 2009 in which soldiers are accused of killing at least 157 people.The indictment could cast doubt upon his participation in elections. He was set to run for the newly created Patriotic Forces for Democracy and Development (FPDD) party against President Alpha Conde.Camara has lived in Burkina Faso since resigning the presidency. He is also recovering from an assassination attempt in Guinea. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
