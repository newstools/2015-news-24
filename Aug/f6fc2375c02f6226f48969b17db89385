"They have asked that foreigners [notably Nigerians] and displaced people in the border areas go home."Some 300 Cameroonian children were removed from their Koranic schools in Maroua and taken back to their villages on Friday, according to a source close to local authorities, as the schools' managers feared that insurgents could try to use them for suicide attacks.Boko Haram's bloody insurgency in Nigeria has left more than 15 000 people dead since 2009 and has increasingly spread across the country's borders, with Chad and Cameroon suffering deadly suicide bombings in recent months. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
