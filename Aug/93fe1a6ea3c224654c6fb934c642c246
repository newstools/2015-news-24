latest assault charge against him will eventually be withdrawn. Jossey Buthane said that two other assault cases that had
been laid against him in the past had been ''thrown out of court''. He believed some people who wanted to become popular used
his name and said he had assaulted them. Buthane appeared in the Mankweng Magistrate's Court on
Thursday on a charge of common assault. He allegedly hit a University of Limpopo student with a
stick during a student gathering last week, Colonel Ronel Otto said. Buthane was released on bail and is expected back in the
court on September 23. In February 2012, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting
ANC Youth League member Herman Mabelebele at a rally, also at the university. In September 2014, Buthane faced a charge of assault with
intent to do grievous bodily harm for allegedly beating Rudzani Ntwampe at an
EFF meeting in Mahwelereng township outside Mokopane, according to an IOL report.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
