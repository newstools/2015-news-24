A 60-year-old man found himself in a pinch after paddling out to sea at Mnandi Beach on Monday last week.Mario Fredericks, NSRI Strandfontein station commander says: At 13:02 the NSRI Strandfontein duty crew were activated by the report of a lone paddler being swept out to sea on a paddle ski at Kapteinseklip. It appears that the 60-year-old man had launched at Mnandi Beach to fish from his paddle ski a normal weekday leisure activity for the man but strong offshore winds began to pick up suddenly at about 10:00.The man was only a few hundred metres offshore and tried to paddle back to shore. Increasing wind speeds prevented him from getting to shore. He was able to reach rocks at Kapteinseklip, off Mnandi Beach.The man was sheltered there when bystanders saw him and raised the alarm. While responding to the scene we alerted the local law enforcement marine officers and they launched their rubber duck and rescued the man from the rocks and brought him safely to shore without incident, Fredericks adds.They also recovered the man s paddle ski.The man was not injured but was extremely grateful for the quick response.At the time of his launch there were windless conditions but the wind quickly increased to close to 50km/h.The NSRI urges sea users to check the weather forecast before launching their vessels and to always be prepared for the worst24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
