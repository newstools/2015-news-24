That even in post-apartheid South Africa, the rights of mine workers are routinely violated is a national disgrace."From October 12 to October 23, the High Court in Johannesburg will hear argument on whether the case should be permitted to proceed as a "class action"."It is the view of Sonke and the TAC that should the court decline to certify the class, it would effectively leave thousands of people without access to justice &ndash; unable to access the compensation due to them because they do not have the resources to access courts through any other means except a class action."The NGOs said the class action, if successful, would be the largest ever in South Africa and would have widespread ramifications for mineworkers, their families and the gold mining industry.The &nbsp;TAC would also picket outside the court and outside the offices of the Teba miners recruitment agency in Idutywa and Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape as "many of the affected miners over the years have come from these areas".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
