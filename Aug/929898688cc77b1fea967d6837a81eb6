Livelihood options are projected to be constrained in most of the country, but especially in the south," Fewsnet was quoted as saying.Vast areas of southern and western Zimbabwe suffered crop failures this year due to lack of rain. Fewsnet said earlier this year that food shortages could reach crisis levels by July if there was no food aid. Media reports said last month that the southern African country needed at least 700 000 tons of maize to avert the food crisis. The imports will cost the country's cash-strapped treasury around $224m, according to analysts. Zambia has already started exporting grain to Zimbabwe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
