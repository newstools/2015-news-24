In July last year, Gersowsky, a 15-year old pupil from the United States, came to Cape Town on holiday with his family. During the holiday he spent a week volunteering at the Habitat for Humanity head office in Claremont.On returning home, he rallied up a few friends and they decided to collect musical instruments for the children of the community to give them the opportunity to experience music as an extracurricular activity, something that they did not have the resources for to enjoy. In addition to the instruments, they began collecting art and school supplies.Gersowsky and his friends managed to collect more than 200kg of school stationery, art supplies, books and musical instruments (guitars and recorders) to be distributed to the Cape Gateway International Church and the Pelican Park Primary School. We are so inspired by the donations we have received, it s really something special, says Gersowsky.His plans for the future are to continue to support the community of Pelican Park, along with Habitat for Humanity, as well as grow their collection bases within the United States, with their ultimate goal being to partner South African schools with American schools.V To get involved or find out more about Kids Kare 4 Cape Town, contact Habitat for Humanity on 021 657 5640 or info@habitat.org.za24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
