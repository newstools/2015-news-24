He is normally resident in the United States.More than 50 000 people died in the 11-year conflict and many more were left maimed by the notorious Revolutionary United Front. Taylor is now serving a 50-year sentence for war crimes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
