	     New York - Amnesty International is accusing UN peacekeepers of killing a 16-year-old boy and his father and raping a 12-year-old girl in separate incidents in Central African Republic. A statement on Tuesday says the two incidents on August 2 and 3 occurred as the peacekeepers were carrying out an operation in the capital, Bangui. Amnesty International says a spokesperson for the UN peacekeeping mission told the human rights organisation that it has opened an internal investigation into the alleged rape and killings. Spokespeople for the UN peacekeeping office were in a meeting about the Amnesty statement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The UN has been under scrutiny over its handling of allegations of child sexual abuse by French soldiers in Central African Republic last year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
