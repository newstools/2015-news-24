"Disciplinary action has been taken against the policeman who was responsible for him," said spokesperson Kay Makhubela. "He is under suspension and there will be a hearing for him later this month in Krugersdorp," Makhubela said. Mdlolo escaped from the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court shortly before he was to be sentenced in December last year. He had been convicted of murder, three rapes, five armed robberies, 10 housebreakings and possession of an unlicensed firearm. Most of his crimes occurred in Kliptown, Soweto. It was believed he had not been cuffed at the time of his escape and police suspected he had been armed. Months later he was still on the run. "We are still searching for him and we have no clue about his whereabouts at the moment," Makhubela said. Police were following up on every lead. "It is disturbing that he has still not been found, but we hope that one day we will catch him and he will face justice," Makhubela said. Last year, police said 32 police officers across Gauteng had been departmentally charged for negligence following the escape of prisoners from custody. After disciplinary proceedings, 22 were found guilty and one of them was dismissed from the service. Six were found not guilty and disciplinary proceedings against four others were pending. Those who were found to have helped prisoners escape were criminally charged.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
