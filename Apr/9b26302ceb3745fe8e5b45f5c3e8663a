	     Gauteng police have confirmed cases of attempted murder and armed robbery have been opened for the Johannesburg bus shooting. Watch.WATCH Johannesburg - The bus driver who was shot and wounded when
he tried to protect his passengers during an armed robbery on the bus in
Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg, on Wednesday was undergoing surgery,
paramedics said. The driver, Selelo Edward Marwala, 58, was in a serious
condition, ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said. One passenger had a graze wound. No one else was injured. Metrobus spokesperson Esther Dryer said a group of six armed
men jumped onto the bus when it stopped on the corner of Hendrik Potgieter and
Ontdekkers roads to pick up a passenger just before 06:00. "The men started shooting randomly, possibly to scare
the passengers and the bus driver intervened." Marwala, who was nicknamed Ace, was shot in the abdomen and
taken to Flora Clinic. Dryer said Marwala was popular with his passengers and would
go out if his way to help them. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
