It has everything&nbsp;to do with politics,&rdquo; said Tumi Mokoena.He said Malema would challenge the SA Revenue Service&rsquo;s bid to sequestrate him. If he is sequestrated he will lose&nbsp;his seat in Parliament.Mokoena said Malema&rsquo;s initial tax bill of R16 million was reduced to R4 million, which was paid. This was due to&nbsp;tax returns he failed to pay between 2006 and 2010. With the collapse of the&nbsp;agreement, Sars now wanted an additional R14 million in interest and penalties.&ldquo;There is no basis for them to levy that,&rdquo; Mokoena said. If Malema&rsquo;s appeal&nbsp;against this failed they would take the matter to the Tax Court, Mokoena said.Sars&rsquo;s bid to get an provisional sequestration order against the Economic Freedom Fighters&rsquo; leader will be heard&nbsp;in the High Court in Pretoria on June 1.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ongoing process of appeals. It will probably take years,&rdquo; Mokoena said.Explaining what he thought had changed at Sars that led to the sequestration bid, Mokoena referred to the romantic&nbsp;relationship between Sars official Johann van Loggerenberg, who had worked on Malema&rsquo;s tax agreement, and lawyer Belinda Walter.Van Loggerenberg was investigated and resigned in February after Walter reported to the police and Sars that he&nbsp;had disclosed confidential tax information to her. This is a crime under the Income&nbsp;Tax Act.&nbsp;According to Mokoena, citing news reports from last year: &ldquo;Van Loggerenberg&hellip; had sent WhatsApp messages to Belinda&nbsp;Walter, in which he stated that the powers that be are not happy with the compromise agreement.&rdquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting that Mr Van Loggerenberg is no longer working for Sars [and] the interim commissioner [Ivan Pillay] was&nbsp;kicked out.&rdquo;Responding to a report that Sars was taking these new steps as Malema&rsquo;s tax payments were from dubious sources, Mokoena&nbsp;said Sars knew where the money came from. In addition there was nothing in the agreement&nbsp;requiring Malema to disclose the source of the payments. &nbsp;&ldquo;Even if that was the case, they have been told who paid the monies. In the first place there&rsquo;s a loan for one&nbsp;million that was paid into the curator&rsquo;s account and the details of the payment&nbsp;appear there. They knew as early as May last year where that money came from.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
