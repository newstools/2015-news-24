Police have issued a stern warning after two elderly women from Diep River were duped by an internet scam. The two women were conned into believing handsome rich men from the UK were on their way to meet them. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Keith Chandler says in both cases the women met the men on the internet. The men are young and send fake pictures of themselves. They claim to be millionaires living in the UK and also claim to have fallen in love with the elderly women, he explains. Chandler says the men claim to be so in love they want to come to South Africa to meet with the women but allege their bank accounts are frozen. They send fake bank accounts to make the story more believable. In both of these cases the women then agreed to pay for their plane tickets. The money is deposited into a Capitec account and the men never arrive, he says. In one of the two cases an elderly woman forked out more than R12 000 for her boyfriend. Chandler says a similar case involving a 49-year-old woman has also been reported at the station. In these cases, the complainants want to open fraud cases but cannot do so because the money was not taken illegally. They gave it voluntary, he says24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
