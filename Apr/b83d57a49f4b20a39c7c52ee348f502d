The correctional services department brought an application on Monday in terms of Section 49 of the Correctional Services Act, which allows for terminally ill awaiting trial remand prisoners to be released for medical care. Louca’s lawyers told the court during the application that he was in the final stages of lung cancer and a doctor had also found growths in his throat, meaning he would eventually probably choke to death. In a surprise testimony, Louca said he wanted to go to Cyprus to be with his family and promised to come back for his trial in September. But Borchers would not grant this request. “Any order I make for his release would have the effect of permanently preventing the state from prosecuting [him]. She did not believe he would come back after Louca had already slipped over the border to Mozambique following Jackson’s murder, and had said he would only supply his secret address in Cyprus once he knew he was safe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
