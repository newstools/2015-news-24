Justice and Human Rights Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba said on Thursday that the government has nothing to hide surrounding the burial of 421 bodies in rural Maluku. He said inquests by the judiciary, administration and police have been opened. Authorities say the bodies are mostly fetuses, stillborn babies and homeless people that were buried to make more room in the Kinshasa morgue. Opposition leader Martin Fayulu has said the bodies include people killed during demonstrations against the revision of an electoral law in January. The opposition and rights groups have called for an independent investigation. The United Nations on Wednesday recommended Congolese authorities exhume the bodies. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
