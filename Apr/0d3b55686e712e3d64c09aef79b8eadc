CITY CA Roshan Morar s appointment as chair of Sanral avoids addressing the real issues concerning tolling and petrol price hikes.Morar can make all the right noises about Sanral since as an employee it would not be in his interests to do otherwise, but unless he addresses why motorists have to pay four times to use public roads he and Sanral are barking up the wrong tree . Since self-propelled vehicles began using roads, governments introduced an annual licence fee which was supposed to be used to construct and maintain roads.During the sixties, when the Broederbond-dominated Nationalists began misappropriating public funds to maintain their homeland policies, they instituted a levy of 2c per litre of petrol at the pumps, with the excuse that the revenue so generated would be used to upgrade inter- provincial roads to world-class standards .As the misuse of state revenue continued unabated, the Nationalists used spurious excuses to build toll plazas, much against the huge outcry from the motoring public.Come 1994 and the ANC government realized that tolling can be an instant cash cow - hence the introduction of e-tolling on inter-city roads.In Robert Nicolai s letter (Witness 6 November, 2014), he rightfully questioned the logic of e-tolling since 81% of the revenue goes to the Austrian Billing Co. What logic was used by Sbu Ndebele to conceive such a system is beyond ordinary comprehension .The ANC is obsessed with taxing the paying public in order to employ more of its cadres, who in turn make the right noises that appeal to the gullible masses that blindly vote for it election after election .As an auditor Morar should have been employed to figure out why the millions pouring in from motorists is not judiciously utilised to benefit motorists and not cadres. More of Morar s propaganda about Sanral and its creation can be read in last year s glossy magazine - another waste of taxpayers money.DALEEP SANMountain Rise24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
