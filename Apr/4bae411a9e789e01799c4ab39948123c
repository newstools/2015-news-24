"The family had been camping here but the student had gone with friends without telling his parents."The extremists lined up non-Muslim students for execution in what Kenyatta described as a "barbaric medieval slaughter".Kenyan warplanes this week destroyed two Islamist bases, following a promise by Kenyatta that he would retaliate "in the severest way possible".Long, gruesome warThe Shabaab fled their power base in Somalia's capital Mogadishu in 2011, and continue to battle the AU force, Amisom, sent to drive them out that includes troops from Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.The group has carried out a string of revenge attacks in neighbouring countries, notably Kenya and Uganda, in response to their participation in the AU force.Since the attack, the Shabaab have warned of a "long, gruesome war" unless Kenya withdraws its troops from Somalia.Shabaab fighters also carried out the Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi in September 2013, a four-day siege which left at least 67 people dead.A $215 000 bounty has also been offered for alleged Shabaab commander Mohamed Mohamud, a former Kenyan teacher said to be the mastermind behind the attack and believed to now be in Somalia.Authorities have named one of the four gunmen killed as a fellow Kenyan - a once promising university law graduate called Abdirahim Abdullahi, an ethnic Somali - highlighting the Shabaab&rsquo;s ability to recruit within the country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
