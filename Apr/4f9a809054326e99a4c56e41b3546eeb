	     More than a century of culture has been captured in an exhibition celebrating the Cape Malay choirs. Launched at the Naspers Building on the Foreshore, the exhibition includes the coveted “Silver Fez” – the trophy awarded to the winning choir. The exhibition comprises photos taken over the years by photographer Yunus Mohamed and floats created by different choirs. The floats started out as vehicles in the 1960s, explains Young Men choir master Abduraghmaan Morris. When the competitions moved to the Athlone stadium the choirs started making mini-floats which stood on tables. The detailed floats depict a range of scenes, from the Adderley Street flower sellers to labourers on wine farms. Cape Malay choirs have been in existence since 1887, says Cape Malay Choir Board chairperson Shafick April. Over 124 choirs have been affiliated to the board over the years. There are currently 25 choirs registered with the board 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
