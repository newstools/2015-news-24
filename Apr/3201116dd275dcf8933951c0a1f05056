Instead, Beeka and Krejcir came afterwards.He said the murder of Jackson happened on May 3 2010, the night before his (Louka's) own stolen property case in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court.Krejcir later asked Louka to go back with him to the house, but he refused to go and dispose of the body.''I take off," he said.Slipped over borderKrejcir had told him to go to a person called Michael at the Nicol Hotel to help him escape, but instead, he ''slipped'' over the Mozambique border by putting $1 000 on top of his ID book when he gave it to customs officials. They accepted it and he crossed the border.From there, he went to Portugal and then to Cyprus.He said he had already been threatened in Cyprus after Krejcir asked him to become an ''agent'' for receiving and selling drugs. He said that he had refused.He said he also contacted investigating officer Pieter van Heerden and repeatedly said he would come back to South Africa if the police could guarantee his safety.He alleged that Mabasa and Krejcir were involved in corruption. ''Joey Mabasa and Radovan, they have big business together and Radovan and Mabasa, they have corruption business together so Radovan, very simple, is a rich one. I am poor."He begged Borchers to let him go to his wife and four children in Cyprus.''Allow me to be next to my family. If it happens, I want to be next to my family. Please. Please. Please."Louka sucked on his oxygen nebuliser and continued.''I didn't kill Lolly," he said.Beeka was murdered in a drive-by shooting in 2011.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
