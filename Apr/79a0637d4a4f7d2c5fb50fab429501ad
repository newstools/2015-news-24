WATCH Polokwane - A cyclist was killed when he was allegedly attacked by a giraffe in Bela Bela at the weekend, Limpopo police said on Monday. Colonel Ronel Otto said the body of the man was found by guests at the Thabo Monate Game Lodge on Sunday afternoon. "He had gone cycling alone. That area of the lodge is known as a habitat for giraffes," she said. "He was allegedly attacked, or trampled, by a giraffe. An inquest docket has been opened and a post mortem would be done later today [Tuesday] to determine the cause of death." In 2013 a giraffe attacked two cyclists in the Groenkloof Nature Reserve in Pretoria. The animal reportedly trampled one of their bikes and chased them before giving up. The incident was captured on video.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
