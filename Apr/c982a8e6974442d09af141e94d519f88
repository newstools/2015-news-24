Both received medals.&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t tell the two apart. He was very humble. Last year, I can remember his pants were becoming shorter and he put his pants into his socks and pulled his socks up. It didn&rsquo;t bother him&rdquo;.&ldquo;It is really traumatic. The teachers and pupils still can&rsquo;t function properly.&rdquo;Benjamin was allegedly stabbed to death by a Grade 6 pupil outside the school on Monday afternoon, according to the provincial education department.Western Cape police spokesperson Andre Traut said a fellow pupil stabbed him during an apparent argument at the end of the school day.&nbsp;"The suspect cannot be named due to his age, but has been handed to Department of Social Development for assessment," he said.The Cape Times reported that Benjamin had apparently told a fellow pupil he should not smoke at school and the boy allegedly replied: &ldquo;I will stab you&rdquo;.It reported that a knife was pulled, and Benjamin was stabbed in the chest.Jessica Shelver, spokesperson for Education MEC Debbie Schafer, said Benjamin managed to run back to the school and tell the secretary that a fellow pupil had stabbed him.The school called the police and ambulance services, but the principal decided to rush the boy to hospital in his own car, she said.He was later transferred to Groote Schuur Hospital, where he died on Monday evening. &ldquo;The principal visited the home of the alleged perpetrator to tell his mother about the incident,&rdquo; Shelver said.A psychologist and the school&rsquo;s social worker were providing counselling to Benjamin's classmates, brother and mother.The boy&rsquo;s aunt, Essy, told News24 that his funeral would be held next Saturday.The school would also hold a memorial service at a church hall opposite its premises at noon on Thursday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
