Jana van der MerweKIM McCusker, the young Johannesburg &shy;advocate who was dragged underneath a taxi for more than 700&thinsp;metres in &shy;September 2011, will receive R10,4 million from the Road Accident Fund.McCusker and the fund yesterday reached a settlement. McCusker initially claimed &shy;almost R16 million, but she and her legal team eventually settled on R10,4 million. Her medical aid had already been paid R2 million and McCusker has received R1 million in damages. She was driven over and dragged&shy; &shy;underneath the taxi, with the tar road shredding parts of her body to the bone.She is in constant pain and cannot sit, stand or lie in one position for a long time. She still has to undergo extensive plastic &shy;surgery.&ldquo;I cannot say I am totally satisfied, but the trial was &hellip; emotionally and physically traumatic. If it had to continue another year, it would have made even more demands on me and my marriage. I chose the lesser of two evils,&rdquo; she said. Her father, Douglas McCusker, who acted as her lawyer, confirmed they decided for logistical reasons to accept the settlement. &bull;&thinsp;The attempted murder case against &shy;taxi driver Matome Thamage resumes on May 19 in the Randburg Magistrate&rsquo;s Court.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
