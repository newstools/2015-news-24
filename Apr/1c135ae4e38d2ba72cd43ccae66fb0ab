However, the boy was in the company of his uncle and they decided to sleep on the ground. The lion came and attacked him before dragging him away.&rdquo;He said only the boy&rsquo;s head had been recovered.In 2010 a UN agency had to provide tents and other relief for 100 families that were displaced after five lions from the Dande and Chewore safari areas attacked and killed four people in the same district. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
