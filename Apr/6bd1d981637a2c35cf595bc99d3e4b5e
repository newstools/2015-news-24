Robert Mhlaba, 39, of Khayelitsha, appeared in the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crimes Court, before Magistrate Sabrina Sonnenberg. Prosecutor Gertrude Magopeni said that Mhlaba had used the skimming device to obtain the secret data on the bank cards and, with the use of the data, cloned bank cards.

He faces 58 charges of fraud, one of conspiracy to commit fraud, one charge of the unlawful possession of a skimming device, 12 relating to his unauthorised access to data, and one relating to his unauthorised use of card data.
