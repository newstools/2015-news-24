The dignity of former black academics [at the university] has been restored," he said. Maxwele was referring to former UCT academics AC Jordan and Archie Mafeje, among others, who were alleged victims of discrimination at the university in the 1950s and 60s.UCT&rsquo;s SRC President Ramabina Mahapa told News24 that many of these former academics made "substantial contributions" to the university, but weren&rsquo;t afforded equal recognition at the time.Mafeje, for one, was asked to leave his post as a lecturer in the university&rsquo;s social anthropology department in 1968 following pressure from the Apartheid government. &ldquo;The fact that he [Mafeje] is only being honoured now was the problem. It&rsquo;s a big issue, and has taken too long,&rdquo; Mahapa said on Thursday.TransformationMaxwele, though, was quick to add that the Rhodes Must Fall campaign had less to do with the actual monument.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a question of transformation though. The decision will now allow us to deal with more urgent issues around transformation at UCT.&rdquo;Among these issues are demands to have some of the building names at the university&rsquo;s campus changed too. These include Jameson Hall and Bremner building, among others.The university has yet to respond to the students over these demands, Maxwele added.The Rhodes statue is due to be removed from the UCT campus at 17:00 on Thursday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
