that regulates non-governmental organisations to recognise and register a human
rights group seeking to protect the rights of gay people in the country. The three judges of the high court said in their ruling on
Monday that the Kenyan constitution recognises and protects the rights of
minorities. The non-governmental organisation co-ordination board had
refused to register Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transsexual Intersex Queer-Kenya
rights group on religious and moral grounds. The attorney general and the NGO board and other parties
had opposed the registration of the gay association but the judges said the
Kenyan Constitution does not allow limitation of rights on moral or religious
grounds.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
