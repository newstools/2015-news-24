They are opposing the application.He also ruled that the matter was urgent.No legislationArguments dealt with ethics and philosophy, but Fabricius was clearly in a hurry to get on with it.&ldquo;We can talk the whole week. The question is merely the following: In the absence of legislation, what rights does the applicant have?&rdquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no difference in law you say...between handing over a pill, switching off a [life support] machine, or injecting you with a dose of morphine?&rdquo; Fabricius asked Marais.Marais replied yes.
