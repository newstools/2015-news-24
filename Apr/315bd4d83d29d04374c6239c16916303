They took down all the shacks. Nobody is there now," he said.Ntsokwana said people occupied the land because it was empty. He reiterated that the party's policy was to expropriate land without compensation for equal distribution among citizens."It is up to them [the party] to make the people get the land and get what they want".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
