The friendship was a danger to the EFF, he said.Ramakatsa, who used to be the EFF s national coordinator, said the trouble started at an after-party in a Sandton bar following the EFF s first birthday rally in Thokoza, Soweto, last year.He claimed Malema said: If you are not going to listen to me and Floyd, if you are not going to defend us, we are going to leave you with this thing [the EFF]. Ramakatsa was not fazed by the small turnout. It is better to go to war with a few soldiers you can trust, that you can rely on, that are motivated to go tothe war. For us, it is not about filling the stadium, but about going to war to save the EFF, he said.Ramakatsa noted that some EFF members would also challenge the outcome of the party s people s assembly, where the current leadership was elected.Meanwhile, some officials guarding the gate asked journalists to buy them food from a nearby spaza shop.There was no obvious catering at the rally even though there was evidently enough money to erect a decent stage, hire a good sound system and pay for the buses.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
