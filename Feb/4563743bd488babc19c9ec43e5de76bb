Textbooks in the Seshego warehouse (America Ngwepe, DA)The Seshego warehouse is the province&rsquo;s main warehouse but Smalle is convinced he will find similar problems at the four others in the province.However, Limpopo education department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said it was normal to keep books in a warehouse.&ldquo;This helps in ensuring when schools report shortages the province is able to respond quickly,&rdquo; said Mhlanga.&ldquo;It is actually a pre-emptive measure to warehouse books near districts for easy access because it can take up to six months to secure a delivery from publishers before it gets to schools.&ldquo;It is important to clarify also that the books currently being delivered in schools are not full consignments but only top up.&rdquo; (America Ngwepe, DA)As pupils returned to schools at the beginning of the year, the province assessed shortages due to learner migration.&ldquo;The excess is used to mop up these shortages, a process the Limpopo department has started since the opening of schools,&rdquo; said Mhlanga.Mhlanga accused the DA of scoring points &ldquo;on the basis of ignorance&rdquo;.But DA spokesperson America Ngwepe said the party stands by its statement.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
