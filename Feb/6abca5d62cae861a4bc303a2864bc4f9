	     Johannesburg - The case of 17 people accused of murdering six Kraaifontein men was postponed in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court, Cape Town, the Western Cape Prosecuting Authority said on Tuesday. "The case was postponed to Friday for a bail application," spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said. On 9 December, the bodies of six men, aged between 18 and 30, were found by passers-by at Joostenberg Vlakte, near Kraaifontein. The men were found lying face down with their hands tied behind their backs and appeared to have been stoned to death. On 17 December, eight men were arrested in connection with the crime.  During subsequent court proceedings, charges against one of them were dropped due to insufficient evidence. By 29 December, the total number of people charged with the murders was 13.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
