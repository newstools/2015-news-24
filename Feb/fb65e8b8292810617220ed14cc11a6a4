Pauli van WykA BUSINESSMAN who allegedly owes the Receiver at least R1,8&thinsp;billion may yet get off without paying a cent after President Jacob Zuma &shy;personally stepped in.Jen Chih &ldquo;Robert&rdquo; Huang and his wife Shou Fang and four companies in which the couple are directors or connected with, owe the South African Revenue Service (SARS) an &shy;initial estimate of R540&thinsp;million, according to court papers in a legal battle between SARS and the Huangs. SARS audited the couple&rsquo;s &shy;income between 2008 and 2013.One of their companies is Mpisi Trading 74, a clearing agent that was involved in importing and donating 181&thinsp;300 T-shirts to the ANC before the national elections. Many of the T-shirts featured Zuma&rsquo;s face and ANC slogans. The T-shirts were seized by SARS, and when Mpisi said they were a donation to the ANC, the acting deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay insisted the company pay customs tax. He has since been out in the cold.SARS auditors also discovered four companies &mdash; dubbed the Razi entities &mdash; which together owe the Receiver a further R541&thinsp;million, said SARS senior manager Pieter Engelbrecht in a statement that has been submitted to the Pretoria high court.The probe forms part of a giant tax audit on the Huang couple, which may yet dwarf even the Dave King audit. King eventually paid R700&thinsp;million to SARS.A source said Huang has also made a string of confessions that will increase his taxable income markedly.There are now however fears that the Haung audit will be shelved after Zuma allegedly intervened &shy;personally to ask the new tax &shy;commissioner for a &ldquo;settlement &shy;outside the tax audit&rdquo;.Although the presidency has &shy;acknowledged questions on this &shy;allegation, it has not responded to Beeld after two working days. SARS did not want to comment on &ldquo;taxpayer matters&rdquo;.On December 5, the head of tax and customs investigations, Gene Ravele, reportedly missed a compulsory high-level meeting and was &shy;summoned by a messenger.The source said &ldquo;Ravele sent back a message he was busy sorting out the Mpisi case as was urgently requested by the president&rdquo;. Ravele was then excused from the meeting.Huang and Zuma&rsquo;s family have long maintained close business &shy;relations. Zuma&rsquo;s nephew Khulubuse Zuma is a former chairperson of &shy;Mpisi and Huang has brokered &shy;several deals &shy;between Khulubuse and &shy;Chinese companies, the Mail & Guardian &shy;reported.SARS had been working on the Haung audit for years and Engelbrecht said in his statement to the court the couple had set up eight companies with a multitude of bank accounts to evade tax and &shy;launder money to send &ldquo;very large amounts&rdquo; out of the country.An analysis of the Huang empire found that just Mpisi had over 26 bank accounts at several financial institutions, SARS manager Loraine van Esch said in a second statement.The court papers only mentioned the four Razi entities &mdash; which were used for extensive money laundering according to SARS. Van Esch said the revenue service had identified many more entities of this type in the Haugn empire. SARS&rsquo;s court documents form part of an impugned ex parte application in which SARS successfully &shy;applied for a search and seizure warrant without the Huangs&rsquo; knowledge.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
