"Depending on the outcome of the investigations, if necessary, disciplinary processes will be followed," said spokesperson Prince Hamnca. This is the second child to die this year after being denied treatment at the clinic. Democratic Alliance MPL Jack Bloom said Vincent Mabitwa, 5, died after security barred his father Steven Motsumi from entering the clinic on 7 January. Motsumi rushed his son to the clinic after an object fell on his head and he started bleeding. "The security turned him away, saying that the doctors had left and the nurses told them to only admit pregnant women," Bloom said. "Motsumi took his child to the Daxina private clinic where a doctor certified that the child was dead." On 24 January, three-week-old baby Queen Elizabeth Mashego died in her mother's arms after security guards refused to let her into the clinic. Letty Sebitso took Mashego to the clinic after realising there was something wrong with the baby's head. Hamnca said the clinic's management had contacted Mabitwa's mother to establish what had happened on the day. "The quality assurance officer also arranged a date with the mother for a visit at her home." He encouraged people who had experienced difficulties at health institutions to report their concerns to the quality insurance officers or CEO based at those institutions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
