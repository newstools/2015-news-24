The decision has been made that any amount of money that has been paid to him as a result of lack of information coming from [the EFF] obviously has to be retrieved or recouped from his pension fund, Chaane said.As chief whip of the official opposition in North West, Babuile earned R1?049?314 a year, or just less than R87?500 a month. Because he was sentenced in November, he is liable for his December and January salaries, which translates into roughly R175?000.In a letter to the EFF on February 3, Speaker Susan Dantjie complains that Babuile would not have received the salaries if the EFF had not repeatedly failed to provide her with information about his conviction. She said that this had the irregular effect of paying Babuile s remuneration from November 26.EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi was not available for comment yesterday, saying he was at a funeral.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
