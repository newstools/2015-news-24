About a year ago, we also became aware of another scam involving Cape Town Traffic Services. It is sad that scam artists are exploiting people&rsquo;s desperation for jobs in this manner.&rdquo;He said when a staff member made contact with the person whose details were provided in the post, he was told that he needed a matric certificate and identity document. &ldquo;The staff member was also told to send a text message to the number provided so that banking details could be provided outlining where he needed to deposit the R200 &lsquo;registration fee&rsquo;,&rdquo; Bosman said.&ldquo;&hellip; City of Cape Town has very specific recruitment policies and we will not post adverts on social media without full contact details of the responsible person,&rdquo; added Bosman.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
