In 2009, the scheme was uncovered and he subsequently fled, apparently due to safety concerns.Tannenbaum reeled in more than 880 investors allegedly by promising high returns linked to pharmaceutical imports.Although arrest warrants have been issued for both Tannenbaum and Rees - who is believed to now live in Switzerland - South African authorities have never lodged a formal extradition requests for the pair.This week Tannenbaum said in his interview that he was always ready to talk: "If anybody wants to speak to me, I'm always willing to speak."A Ponzi scheme uses funds from investors to pay generous 'returns' to other investors, rather than distributing actual profits.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
