The Constitutional Court has dismissed former Fidentia chief executive J Arthur Brown s application for leave to appeal his 15-year jail sentence, says the National Prosecuting Authority. We are happy that the Constitutional Court agreed with us that there were no prospects of success in the appeal, said NPA spokesperson Velekhaya Mgobhozi yesterday. This decision brings to an end a process that Mr Brown attempted to frustrate. The judgment was handed down yesterday. The NPA had opposed the application.Brown was convicted on two fraud charges relating to his handling of investments for the Transport Education and Training Authority and the Mantadia Asset Trust Company between 2002 and 2006.He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on each of two fraud charges in the SCA in December. The sentences would run concurrently.This came after the NPA appealed the R150 000 fine (R75 000 for each fraud charge) and suspended jail term handed down by the Western Cape High Court in May 2013.Mgobhozi said: We hope that Mr Brown will now start serving his sentence as his attempts to delay the matter have come to an end. We hope this sentence serves as a warning to other white collars criminals. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
