	     Cape Town - A Grade 8 pupil has died after "train
surfing" on his way to school, according to reports. The Cape Times reported that Ayabonga Mphoso, 15, from
Philippi, was electrocuted while on top of a train travelling from Khayelitsha
to Cape Town on Wednesday morning. He was found with his schoolbooks next to
him.  According to the report, surfing on train roofs has become a
daily occurrence, despite attempts to prevent this practice.  Metrorail said the line had to be closed after the incident,
resulting in two trains being cancelled and four being turned around. Witnesses said shortly after the train left the Philippi
station there was a loud bang and the train came to a halt. They then
discovered the body on the roof.  Another witness told The New Age that the victim was a
regular train surfer and that security at train stations was lacking, with no
visibility of security guards around to prevent train surfers.  An inquest docket has been opened.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
