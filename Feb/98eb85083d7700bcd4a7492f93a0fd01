"The case was opened on Monday. We are at this stage investigating a case of child negligence. Investigation will reveal whether the charge should be assault," said Captain Mega Ndobe. How the boy got burnt would be investigated. No arrest had yet been made. The Daily Sun reported on Tuesday that the toddler's mother Anna Mahlangu, 43, suspected her son's feet were burnt with boiled water on purpose. The boy was burnt on Thursday. "His skin was blistered and his wounds were peeling," she said. "Nobody took care of him. Nobody phoned me to let me know what was going on. I want answers." She told the daily that the creche explained that her son was injured on a hot stoep when he could not jump off the stoep to the grass. "My boy's feet were burnt from his ankles to the sole of his feet. It is obvious it was not from the stoep," she said. Lungelo Day Care manager Jemina Phungwayo said the boy was seriously burnt on his feet but denied that it had been caused by boiling water.
