prison by the Pinetown Regional Court on Monday for raping a University of
KwaZulu-Natal student, KwaZulu-Natal police said. Xabiso Xaki, 22, raped the 21-year-old woman on 25 February 2012,
while her boyfriend was asleep next to her, said Colonel Jay Naicker. "She was raped by Xaki while her boyfriend was fast asleep.
When she woke her boyfriend, Xaki attempted to flee. The boyfriend gave chase
and was able to apprehend the accused." KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Lieutenant General Mmamonnye
Ngobeni congratulated police, the prosecutor and judiciary for ensuring Xaki
paid for his crime. "Any form of violence directed at women and children will not
be tolerated and the SAPS will make sure that perpetrators are brought to
book," she said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
