In a statement, NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said that the incident was witnessed by two off-duty NSRI rescuers who helped the injured man to shore."Two crew members were surfing in the vicinity at the time and they assisted the local man out of the water and they were also assisted by another member of the public," Lambinon said. He added that the man was stabilised by paramedics at the scene before he was airlifted to a local hospital for further treatment. "From descriptions given by the surfer it is suspected that a white shark of about 3m to 3.5m was involved in the encounter although that cannot be confirmed until investigated by authorities based on the bite marks," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
