However Vaz said the cabinet was too large."The presidency asks Carlos Correia to reformulate his 34-member government because the state budget will not be able to cover the cost," said a statement released by Vaz's office.Vaz also complained that the prime minister's cabinet was largely composed of ministers from Pereira's dismissed government, some of whom are facing court cases over alleged corruption.Pereira was himself named on Correia's list as minister to the presidency in charge of cabinet meetings and government spokesman.The former Portuguese colony has become a major transit point for cocaine smuggled from South America to Europe amid chronic political instability that has seen the country rocked by nine coups or attempted coups since 1980. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
