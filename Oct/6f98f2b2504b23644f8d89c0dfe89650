It was wonderful," Gilpin said.After they took&nbsp;the particulars of the volunteers, all of the&nbsp;dogs were housed within two hours."The dogs seem to have settled in quite well. More than 20 foster parents are so in love, they can&rsquo;t give them back and have opted to adopt them," she said, laughing.On Tuesday morning, authorities lined Kommetjie Road after a group of residents burnt a container and tyres on Monday night.The arrest of community leader Lubabalo Willem in connection with a recent spate of mob justice incidents&nbsp;is understood to be the reason for the unrest.Willem appeared in the Simon&rsquo;s Town Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Monday. His next appearance is on Friday. He remains in custody.According to the City of Cape Town, the area is still volatile and authorities remain in the area.The society&rsquo;s management&nbsp;was worried about how long its doors would be closed.Emergency staff&nbsp;are on site but all other operations have ceased."The worst thing is we don&rsquo;t know how long this will carry on.
