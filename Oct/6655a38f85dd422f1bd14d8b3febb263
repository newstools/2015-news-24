	     Polokwane - Limpopo police are investigating two cases of murder after a man was hanged for the death of a 3-year-old boy in Eldorado outside Polokwane. According to police Frederick Makeke, 3, was killed and had his head and private parts cut
off on Monday. Police spokesperson Colonel Ronel Otto said: "The
community accused a man... who was hired to work on the roof of the family's
house... and assaulted him before hanging him." The man died as a result
of the attack. No arrests have yet been made and investigations
into both murders are continuing. The incident happened at the house of the
boy's grandparents. Otto said the boy and another child was apparently
sleeping on the veranda when he was allegedly taken to another house on the
same property. "It was only when the uncle of the boy returned from
work during lunch that it was found that the boy was missing. His body was
found on a bed in a bedroom of the house." The community gathered and allegedly accused the unknown
man before assaulting and hanging him. Otto said they had not ruled out muthi as a motive for
the murder.  The investigation continues.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
