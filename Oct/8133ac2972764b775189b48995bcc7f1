He did not stay for the screening and was not available to comment afterward.In the film, none of the suspected attackers of the boy, or of a woman who lost both arms, has been brought to justice.Film director Vic Sarin said he tried repeatedly to talk to members of the Tanzanian government but had been rebuffed."I did make every effort to be as honest as possible and give everyone a platform," said Sarin.Albinism is a congenital disorder affecting about one in 20 000 people worldwide. It is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and affects about one Tanzanian in 1 400. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
