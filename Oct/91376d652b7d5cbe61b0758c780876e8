There was a clear commitment that they would purchase more ambulances," Govender said."More 4x4 ambulances would be purchased... They committed that ambulances will be fitted with tracking devices, the number of vehicles to transfer people between health services and facilities will be increased so the service will be more reliable."No person would wait longer than four hours for an ambulance, though the aim was for ambulances to arrive much sooner than that.If an ambulance has not arrived as expected, the relevant district mangers could be contacted. The department handed the relevant cellphone numbers to the commission to share with communities in the case of delayed response.Road improvementsThe provincial transport department, which had also participated at the public meeting, pledged to improve certain roads leading to hospitals and rural roads.However, in their submission to the commission, it was emphasised that improving all the province's roads would take many years.Dr Prinitha Pillay, programme manager for human resources for health and policy implementation at the Rural Health Advocacy Project, told media that it was clear there had been multiple violations of citizens&rsquo; rights."What we witnessed was an extreme amount of physical and mental anguish for these communities and their resulting bereavement... certainly needs to be a priority going forward," she said.This was because rural communities tended to be neglected, and since they were rural, suffered from an out-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude."The SAHRC and the state have a responsibility to monitor progress and more importantly whether there is not progress," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
