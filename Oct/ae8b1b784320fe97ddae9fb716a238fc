"We have heard the discontent among senior leaders of the governing party about the way in which current affairs are covered. In my view, tension between the media is healthy; what is important is to know how to deal with it," he said.&nbsp; Ngoepe proposed that there should be education around the existing&nbsp; regulatory system that governs newspaper content,&nbsp;before it is rejected or replaced. He also&nbsp;proposed that the ruling party p ublish a document which would give details of its intentions for a media appeals tribunals. " Since 2007, [the ANC'S] conference resolutions have referred to the need for a parliamentary investigation of the desirability of what it calls a Media Appeals Tribunal, or MAT. Yet no detail &ndash; no discussion paper, no framework, no motivation &ndash; has been provided," Ngoepe said.&nbsp;"I would like to use this platform today to urge the ANC to publish a formal document that can then be used as the basis for public discussion. We need to understand more about the governing party&rsquo;s intentions, so that we can begin the public conversation," he said, adding that this was a matter which had the potential to affect all South Africans.&nbsp;He proposed that there be input from legal experts on the impact that a media tribunal could have.&nbsp;Ngoepe also called on the ANC and the public to acquaint themselves about the workings of the current Press Council Appeals Panel.&nbsp;He also called for the newspaper industry and the journalist to respect the Press Council and the appeals panel, and in particular to respect its judgments.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
