	     Cape Town – Parliament has denied it was interdicted to stop the disciplinary hearings into suspended head of parliamentary security Zelda Holtzman after she approached the Labour Court. Holtzman approached the court with an urgent application to stop it from conducting the hearing, citing late notice. Holtzman's application will now be heard next Friday at the Western Cape Labour Court.  Parliament on Wednesday denied several media reports that it had been forced by the courts to postpone the disciplinary hearing. "Parliament was not forced to postpone its disciplinary hearing concerning the head of the Parliamentary Protection Services Zelda Holtzman," it said in a statement. "As Parliament stated yesterday [Tuesday], it was postponing Holtzman's disciplinary hearing to allow the Labour Court to complete its processes on Holtzman's application." It said Holtzman had indeed applied to the Labour Court to interdict Parliament from proceeding with her disciplinary hearing, which was scheduled for Wednesday. "The Labour Court, however, yesterday [Tuesday] made no order on the matter and is scheduled to hear the application only on November 6." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
