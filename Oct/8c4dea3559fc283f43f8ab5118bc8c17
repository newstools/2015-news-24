It may occur over a period of time.Another Chikanga resident was quoted as saying: "From what I heard, the boy poured too much salt into the... cereal his mother had prepared and while his mother had gone outside to do some chores, he ate a few mouthfuls.""When she got back inside, she noticed he was weak and so she called out to us for help. The doctor confirmed his liver was affected by the excess salt, leading to his death," the resident said.News24 contacted a general medical practitioner over the report, who said: "This could be possible as basically a very high salt intake would cause a significant change in fluid balance and electrolyte disturbance which can affect the heart."The family of the child chased reporters away from the funeral, the Manica Post said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
