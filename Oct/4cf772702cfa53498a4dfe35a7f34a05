However other nations come with selfish interests,&rdquo; he said.Bapela said a national interest policy will be tabled in Parliament and will be fast tracked. The policy will guide a review of the domesticated statutes regarding the ICC membership.Bapela said the NGC also affirmed a view that the African Court of Justice must develop its own capacity to deal with issues of human rights.Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana Mashabane added the big powers put their interests before others.&ldquo;The mere fact that you have two members of the Security Council in another country confirms it is right now to reform,&rdquo; she said.Nkoana-Mashabane said the matter of the ICC is on the agenda of the African Union&rsquo;s meeting in January.She said South Africa has already written to the Assembly of State Parties requesting that it includes an agenda item about the review of the Rome Statute for its November meeting.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
