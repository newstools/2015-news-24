	     Johannesburg - Tshwane Bus Services (TBS) will take disciplinary action against bus drivers who left commuters without bus tickets stranded at bus stops since the start of the week, after refusing to sell them tickets.  A City of Tshwane statement said such "deviant behaviour" from drivers constituted misconduct upon which TBS management frowned. "The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) affiliated bus drivers have been refusing to carry money bags this week," the city said. According to the metro, the drivers believed carrying cash made them easy targets for criminals with the drivers demanding the introduction of an automated bus fare system. "The city remains committed to introducing the automated fare system on all TBS buses and was already looking into the legal and procurement processes related to the contract of the project," it said. "We expect our drivers to continue selling cash tickets on the buses, carry money bags and pick up all the commuters like normal, until such time the status quo changes." All drivers who left commuters stranded had been identified and legal processes were underway to institute disciplinary proceedings against them. "The city takes a dim view of any form of misconduct committed by any its employees," it said. "We wish to reiterate our humble apology to all  the TBS commuters that have been inconvenienced by the irresponsible, illegal and unlawful behaviour of certain bus drivers." Samwu regional secretary Mpho Tladinyane said workers were doing what they agreed with the employer. "Samwu would do whatever it takes to represent its members," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
