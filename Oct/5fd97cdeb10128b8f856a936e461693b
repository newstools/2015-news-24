Ruvarashe Matingwina was reportedly holding onto her mother's hand as they crossed the Nyatsime River on their way home on Friday&nbsp;when the crocodile grabbed the child's leg. Crocodiles are rarely seen in Harare or in Chitungwiza, which is about 20km away from the capital.

The mother is reported to have screamed for help but her child's body was only found in reeds in Chitungwiza&nbsp;on Saturday&nbsp;morning. Police have confirmed the tragedy.
