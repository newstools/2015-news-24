	     Durban - A mother and daughter pair – who
kidnapped a neighbour's child and changed her name to collect a social grant –
were convicted in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. The two were found guilty of charges of kidnapping
and fraud, and will serve eight and 14 years in prison respectively. Police spokesperson Colonel Jay Naicker
said in a statement the pair had kidnapped a 7-year-old girl in Folweni while
she was waiting for a train in 2010. “She was on her way back from school when
she was approached by the accused, who told her that her mother had asked that
she be taken home. The child was held at the accused’s home in Folweni. “The child’s surname was changed and the
second accused [50-year-old mother] applied for a new birth certificate at the
Department of Home Affairs so that she could obtain a social grant [R330
monthly],” Naicker said. Meanwhile, the girl’s frantic mother had
gone to the police in a desperate attempt to find her daughter. “The child’s picture was published in the
media. A member of the community recognised her and contacted the police,” he
said. “The daughter [was] sentenced to 14 years
for kidnapping and 6 years for fraud whilst her mother received 8 years for
kidnapping and 6 years for fraud. Their respective sentences will run
concurrently,” Naicker added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
