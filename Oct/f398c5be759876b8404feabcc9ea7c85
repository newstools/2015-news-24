Corruption imposes heavy costs on the economy and distorts development policies. It hurts the poor disproportionately by diverting funds intended for development," Masire was quoted as saying.He made the remarks during the opening of the first international conference on governance and service delivery in developing economies in Kampala recently, the report said.This was not the first time Masire, who is credited for entrenching democracy in his country, has spoken about bad governance and corruption.In August, during the Pan-African Parliament in Midrand, Masire referred to corruption as "an evil scourge", according to an SABC report.Masire said corruption eroded the moral fibre of the continent."Corruption is an evil. It is something that has really ruined the economy, the morals and everything of a value in a society, because the quality of the services we get is bad," Masire was quoted as saying.Watch the video below as Masire speaks.&lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&gt;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
