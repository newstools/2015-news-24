"The application for referral constitutional court is devoid of merit... it has only delayed the process of the court."Bronkhorst looked dejected and refused to speak to journalists when he came out of the courtroom in the western town of Hwange."We disagree with the ruling with all due respect. It is our intention to apply to the high court for a review," his lawyer Perpetua Dube said.Palmer, a dentist from Minnesota, was hounded on social media over the killing and went into hiding after demonstrations outside his dental practice.Zimbabwean authorities last week dropped plans to seek Palmer's extradition to face charges, saying his papers were in order and that he was misled into believing that the hunt was legal.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
