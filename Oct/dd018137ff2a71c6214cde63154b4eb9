"Those are currently allegations. We were never informed of this and no cases were opened by the alleged victims," said Limpopo police spokesperson, Colonel Ronel Otto. She was responding to a report in the Sowetan that police had shot and wounded two pupils - a 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl - from the Mpandeli Secondary School, last week. They were waiting at a bus stop at nearby Gaba village, about 27km east of Thohoyandou, when they were apparently shot. Police were attending to protests related to a ritual murder in nearby Tshidzini village at the time. The parents of both pupils said they intended opening cases, the Sowetan reported. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesperson, Grace Langa, said the matter had not been reported to the police watchdog. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
