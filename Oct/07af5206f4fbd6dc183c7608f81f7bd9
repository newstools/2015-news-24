damages arising from the birth of a brain-damaged baby at Durban’s Prince
Mshiyeni Hospital. Busisiwe Mngoma (on behalf of her daughter Sbongakonke
Asanda Mngoma, who was born on August 4, 2012) has sued the health authorities
for R11 800 000, but the amount she will receive will be determined at a future
hearing. On Wednesday, Judge Sharmain Balton granted a consent order
in which the Health MEC admitted the department was liable to pay Mngoma for
whatever damages she was able to prove. Her claim is based on the fact that medical staff at Prince
Mshiyeni Hospital were negligent by unnecessarily prolonging her labour,
failing to monitor the condition of the foetus and the mother during labour,
failing to timeously establish that the baby was at risk and failing to
expedite the birth. The court papers also state that the staff did not
resuscitate the baby timeously after birth, failed to admit her immediately to
the neonatal intensive care unit when they should have done so, and also failed
to provide the mother and child with proper medical care and treatment. As a result, the baby was born with brain damage. She is
blind and will remain totally dependent on others for all her daily
requirements for the rest of her life. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
