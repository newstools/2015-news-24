This process had started in October 2014, and 30 open days had also been held within the affected communities, Herron said."Furthermore, we are of the opinion that the said dispute deals with the nature of the obligations imposed by the Constitution and the Local Government Municipal Systems Act on the city in facilitating public participation, and whether the city has met those obligations."He said it was necessary to identify the scope of these obligations and how they should be properly executed."This dispute therefore involves a question of law that is of sufficient importance to warrant a decision by the Supreme Court of Appeal."He said the application for leave to appeal was filed with the registrar of the court on Monday and would be argued on a date allocated by the registrar.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
