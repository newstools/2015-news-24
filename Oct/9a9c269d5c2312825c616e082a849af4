Lady Chief Justice (Wood)," said a statement from the Judicial Service announcing a decision by Vice President Kwesi Amissah-Arthur based on advice from the Judicial Council.The council previously suspended 22 junior judges who appeared in the video and investigated the conduct of high court judges to see if there is a case for their impeachment.Some of the judges have denied wrongdoing and have filed a challenge in court, saying their suspension had no legal basis because documents relating to the video that were submitted by the journalist were not made available to them.In 2013, the Supreme Court dismissed an election challenge by the political opposition, which had sought to annul the re-election of President John Mahama the previous year.The ruling, which followed months of testimony, was accepted by the opposition and the case and its outcome was viewed as a testament to the judiciary's authority. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
