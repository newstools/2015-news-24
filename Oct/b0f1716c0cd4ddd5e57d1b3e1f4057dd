	     Pretoria – Pretoria bus drivers were likely to strike on Monday after disciplinary action was taken against some of them, the City of Tshwane has warned. The city was issuing suspension notices to 98 drivers and 41 other employees involved in an unprotected strike on October 1, 2, and 5, spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said on Friday. In addition, some drivers faced disciplinary proceedings for failing to carry or use their money bags, refusing to sell tickets to passengers, and leaving passengers without tickets stranded. The city estimated that 60% of drivers would refuse to work on Monday.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
