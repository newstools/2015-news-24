My four-year-old son and my 13-year-old daughter are having the best time with him."Seeger said her family read about Chino&rsquo;s story and felt he was "a great survivor"."I would encourage people to adopt rescued pets. There are so many pets that need loving homes."When asked why the family decided to take Chino home, Seeger said they had a general love for animals."We got him so he could join our seven-year-old dog. He has been amazing so far. He loves digging holes and eating strawberries," said an amused Seeger."He is such a sweetheart. I don&rsquo;t think he even knew what a bed was. When we made one for him he seemed surprised that he was allowed to sleep there."Seeger heaped praise on the resilient puppy, saying he was a "blessing to our family".&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
