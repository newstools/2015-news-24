The attack took place overnight Wednesday."We thought the attacks against albinos had declined, but this shows albinos are being targeted, especially in this election period," said Vicky Ntetema of Under The Same Sun, an organisation defending the rights of albinos in Tanzania.At least 76 albinos have been murdered since 2000 with their dismembered body parts selling for around $600 and entire bodies fetching $75 000, according to UN experts.Dozens more have survived having parts of their bodies hacked off while alive.On Tuesday, Tanzania's ruling party presidential election candidate John Magufuli denounced the killing of albinos as "silly" and a "national shame".In March, outgoing President Jakaya Kikwete said attacks against people with albinism were "disgusting and a big embarrassment for the nation".Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
