My children would grow up without feeling the warmth of their father and I am tired of this endless trial. ... Is it not better to die?" Okah told the court before trying to smash a chair through the window of the third-floor courtroom. He was restrained.Okah's brother, Henry, was convicted in South Africa in 2013 of the 2010 bombing and other terrorism acts and sentenced to 24 years' imprisonment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
