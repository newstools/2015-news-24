Law enforcement officials have expressed concern that further chaos could allow traffickers to thrive once again.In an effort to kick-start Guinea-Bissau's economy, Vaz last week met Chinese investors who signed a memorandum of understanding for investments in agriculture, health and manufacturing.Guinea-Bissau is notoriously unstable even by the standards of a region known for military takeovers and civil wars. No elected president has served a complete term since independence from Portugal in 1974, and there have been nine coups or attempted coups since 1980. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
