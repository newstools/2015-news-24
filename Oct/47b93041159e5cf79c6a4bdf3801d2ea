While the NHI white paper is yet to be released, the NHI Bill was gazetted last year.A discussion paper on financing options is yet to released by the National Treasury, to accompany the NHI white paper.Meanwhile, the ANC flexed more of its muscle when it endorsed the ANAs which had pitted Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga against teacher unions.The SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) and the National Professional Teachers Organisation of South Africa (Naptosa) last month raised concerns about the frequency of the testing and the demands on administration.This led Motshekga to postpone assessments until next year. Learners were supposed to have sat for the ANAs last month but the unions complained about their readiness.Pandor said not a single member of the alliance partners came out to speak against pressing ahead with the ANAs.&ldquo;The view was that this is an important strategy. Where there are disagreements and concerns about implementation, the process of review has been set in motion and we must allow it. That process should not make us detract from ANAs. That was the strong sentiment and it was supported,&rdquo; she said.A task team of department officials and unions will consider proposals for re-designing the assessments to be relaunched next year.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
