The new Picu will be able to accommodate more patients than before and will have isolation units to avert cross-infection and a specifically designed area for neonatal care.The expansion and upgrade will also create a comfortable and supportive space for parents and breastfeeding mothers. Currently, family members have no privacy or space between life-saving equipment as they hold vigil at their child&rsquo;s side. Increased space will also mean that staff who work very long hours saving lives in tough conditions, will have adequate accommodation. These staff members work tirelessly to provide clinical, educational and research services.The current Picu at the Red Cross Children&rsquo;s Hospital is already the largest intensive care unit for children in Africa. There is a dire need to boost its capacity due to the growing demand for Picu beds.The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Trust is fundraising for the project cost. Government will contribute R30m.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
