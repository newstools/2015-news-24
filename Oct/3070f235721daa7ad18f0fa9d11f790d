He was said to have joined them after arriving in Sicily in mid-February, mixed with other boat migrants.His arrest raised public fears that terrorists could hide among the tens of thousands of economic migrants and asylum seekers who land on Italian shores each year. But it also raised suspicions that his was a case of mistaken identity.Teachers of an Italian language course for foreigners where Touil had enrolled said in several media interviews that he was in class when the Bardo Museum attack took place, as well as in the days leading up to it.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
