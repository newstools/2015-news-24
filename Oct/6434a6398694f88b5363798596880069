Hanson initially worked for Phoenix Animal Care and Treatment where he worked with abused, neglected and abandoned pups. He soon however, decided there was a need for an organisation which focused solely on helping puppies in need, and Puppy SOS was born. Hanson said the organisation’s mission is to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home abused, unwanted and homeless puppies in KZN. Since launching in August 2014, Puppy SOS has re-homed over 200 puppies as well as educate and assist with sterilisation in underprivileged areas. In order to continue the great work Puppy SOS does, they rely heavily on public donations and foster homes. Their next fund raiser will take place at the Mozambik restaurant in Hillcrest on Tuesday 24 November. Hanson and his team will be hosting a fund raising race night to help with vet costs and kennel fees. There will be eight races on the night where one can place bets on a horse coming over the line first and take home a share of the prize fund. Takings from the races is split 50/50 between the prize fund and the fund raising. Tickets cost R100 and one can book a seat with Mozambik Hillcrest. “Puppy SOS would love to see you there and it also offering local businesses the chance to sponsor one of the races on the night. “If you cannot attend on the night, check out the Facebook page for details of how to become one of the race horse owners or jockey where you can still stand a chance of cashing in on the winning horses,” said Hanson.
