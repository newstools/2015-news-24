Abyan said in a statement from Nauru she had not changed her mind, but had been denied an interpreter and counselling."I have been very sick," she wrote in a signed statement. "I have never said that I did not want a termination."Lawyer George Newhouse said on Monday that he had started preparing an application for a temporary court injunction keeping her in Australia when he discovered Abyan was to be sent back to Nauru. She was gone he could make the application."When we heard an hour before she was being removed from the country without treatment &mdash; that that was going to happen &mdash; of course we tried to stop her for going back without treatment," Newhouse told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, adding it was a temporary injunction and not an effort to keep her in Australia permanently.Newhouse could not be immediately contacted for comment. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton denied Abyan's claims that she was not given access to doctors or an interpreter.He said 240 asylum seekers who have come to Australia for medical treatment from Nauru had succeeded in getting court injunctions preventing their return.Neil Skill, first assistant secretary of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, told a Senate committee on Monday that he decided to charter a flight because there were no commercial seats available on the day and he was worried about the disruption that Abyan might cause on a commercial flight if she did not want to return to Nauru.Abyan could later decide to return for an abortion in Sydney, Skill said. Abortions are legal for the first 20 weeks of pregnancy in Australia. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
