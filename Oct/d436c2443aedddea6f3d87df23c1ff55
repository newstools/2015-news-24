THE St Cathryn's Inter-club team have been seen at the gym, on the driving range and even huffing and puffing jogging along the road - some have even resorted to banting to get into shape before the start of inter-club on Friday 30 October. The team will leave on Thursday morning for a practice round at Selborne to get acclimatised and this will also be the last opportunity to tweak the team selections. St Cathryn’s are proud to play in their Plennegy-sponsored shirts and caps and thank the Plennegy Group for its generous sponsorship and valued support. St Cathryn’s has in the past made the finals of the Alliance twice, with one of their frog teams, and last year the one Frog team won that section. We as a club are happy to announce that our neighbour - Greytown Country Club - has accepted our challenge to play in an unofficial test series over the weekend - and we look forward to the challenge. Captain Dieter Meyer is expecting a high standard of play from the St Cathryn’s team. We wish them a weekend with great golf and friendly camaraderie. Frog 1: Paul Els, Dieter Meyer and Brent Barkhuizen. Frog 2: Deon van Dyk, Darrin Manser and Jarad Manser. Senior Frog: Neill Manser, Piet Nel and Mike Harrison. Good luck boys. This Friday 30 October supper will be Spagetti Bolognaise with salad and pudding. To book, contact Cathy on 082 555 2661.
