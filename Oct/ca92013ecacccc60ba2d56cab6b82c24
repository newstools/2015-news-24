JOHANNESBURG-BORN solo cyclist­ Gaven Sinclair, now living in Cape Town, is cycling from Cape Town to Cairo. Tuesday, 6 October was his 45th day of cycling and he was in Port Shepstone. Sinclair said the cycle is for the Red Cross psychosocial support initiative to raise funds for orphans and vulnerable people. “I started cycling from 15 August. My challenge will take me approximately 10 to 12 months. “I am on the 45th day and still going,” said Sinclair. He said the peddling has not been easy because the bike is, at the moment­, not in good condition, so Sinclair­ is looking for sponsors and hopefully a new bike. Sinclair has faced some challenges with his bike and on Tuesday he had to have it repaired by Bobby Cycles in Port Shepstone. “Mohammed did a very good job for free on my bike and with his help I will be able to continue with my journey,” he said. Sinclair invites all who want to sponsor or keep in touch to follow him on his Facebook page Gaven Sinclair or go on the Red Cross website www.redcross.org.za
