The festival took place from October 6 to 10&nbsp;in Potchefstroom.Aardklop marketing manager Chrizanda Botha said while no complaints were received form festival goers, Aardklop did not approve singing Die Stem apart from when it was sung as part of the national anthem."We are not being prescriptable in their contracts in terms of what they may and may not sing; they determine their own line-ups," she said."Although we allow their freedom of artistic expression, we do however expect of them to be responsible in their choice of offering."NWU on Thursday distanced itself from the performance, saying it "did not want to be associated with the use of cultural artefacts and symbols of our painful past".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
