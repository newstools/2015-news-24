When we say demands, we don't expect negotiations but we expect answers," he saidHe told management that they were either "with or against us".Student leaders said the crowd would not be leaving until they were given answers and that officials should stay.In a statement on Monday, the university said its executive was committed to discussion and were "attempting to persuade the group to join them at the table for talks".UCT said it was concerned that certain students were interfering with the rights of the university executive to move freely."We remain very concerned that the protest action is unlawful and that the action of students has brought the operations of the campus to a standstill."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
