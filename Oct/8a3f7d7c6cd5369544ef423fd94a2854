By the time my term of office expires, the 2.2 million jobs will be out there," Zhuwawo was quoted as saying.Zhuwawo said the government was working on a comprehensive national economic empowerment strategy to ensure all Zimbabweans benefited from the country's indigenisation and empowerment processes.Reports on Monday indicated that the minister had proposed a 10% empowerment levy on companies as part of efforts to generate internal resources to fund the indigenisation programme."For us to be able to fund empowerment programmes in the long&ndash;term, we are proposing the introduction of an empowerment levy and we&rsquo;re empowered by law to propose the law," the state-controlled Chronicle newspaper quoted Zhuwawo as saying.Fin24 reported on Wednesday that Zimbabwe was imposing an additional tax burden on foreign-owned companies after Zhuwawo said the proposed 10% empowerment levy to fund indigenisation and economic empowerment would be raised to 12.5% in 2017.Higher taxation framework Zhuwawo said the empowerment levy would raise $93m in 2016 to fund the country's cash-strapped National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Fund.Foreign-owned companies in Zimbabwe are already burdened by the country&rsquo;s controversial 2007 indigenisation law that states foreign-owned companies should hand over a 51% shareholding to local partners to reverse imbalances resulting from colonialism.Zimbabwe also has a higher taxation framework compared to its peers in the region.Mugabe&rsquo;s critics say the policy is the chief cause of investor aversion with some saying the indigenisation campaign has been fraught with ambiguity and corruption on a grand scale.Zhuwawo recently attacked the Minister of Finance Patrick Chinamasa over calls for foreign investment, saying requests for the injection of foreign direct investment were against Zanu-PF's indigenisation policy. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
