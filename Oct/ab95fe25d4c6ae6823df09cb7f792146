them a South African, on board went missing in western Nepal on Thursday during
a morning flight to see the country's snow-capped peaks, an official said. The plane, with a Russian pilot and the South African
passenger, took off midmorning on an hour-long sightseeing tour from Pokhara,
the tourist town's airport chief Deepak Baral said. "When the flight didn't return to Pokhara airport, we
started to make enquiries and realised it was missing," Baral told AFP. "We will continue to search for it," he added. Depending on the amount of fuel on board, such planes can
stay in the air for up to four hours, according to Baral. Pokhara, about 150km west of Kathmandu and flanked by the
majestic Annapurna range, attracts thousands of visitors annually thanks to its
scenic mountain views and clear, dry winters. But the April 25 earthquake, which killed nearly 8 900
people, raised fears for the immediate future of the tourism industry in the
impoverished Himalayan nation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
