Then when he said f*ck you, I asked him f*ck who?&rdquo;&nbsp; Seakeco alleged that after that comment, Hunt slapped him. He also claimed that football players held him back as Hunt continued to shout abuse at him.&nbsp; When City Press contacted Hunt he repeatedly denied assaulting the student.&nbsp; &ldquo;No nothing happened. Let me tell you the police are there and if they get involved it is going to be a problem. No I did not slap him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seakeco said that goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs was also present during the altercation.&nbsp; Josephs could not be reached by phone for comment.&nbsp; Students at Wits began protesting against a fee increase yesterday morning. They blocked a number of the university&rsquo;s entrances and disrupted lectures.&nbsp; They said they would not back down because a great injustice was being done by the management of the institution to, especially poor black students, who could barely afford the current tuition rates.&nbsp; The university confirmed that the protest was continuing today and that many entrances and exits had been blocked by students.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are working on clearing these entrances as quickly as we can, and if needs be with the assistance of the South African Police Services. We have consulted with SAPS on our respective roles and the SAPS has agreed to manage the parameter security. They will assist the university in allowing students, staff and visitors to move freely on and off our campuses,&rdquo; acting vice-chancellor Andrew Crouch said.&nbsp; He said the academic programme would continue as planned, and advised students and staff to &ldquo;remain calm&rdquo; in instances where lectures were disrupted.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are also open to talking to the students and other groups who are protesting in order to find an amicable solution to this matter,&rdquo; said Crouch.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
