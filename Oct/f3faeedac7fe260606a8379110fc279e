The officials, who are loyal to the Islamist-backed government based in Tripoli, say no casualties were reported. The officials say the parliament session continued undeterred, with lawmakers debating names for a potential national unity government. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorised to speak to reporters. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion. Libya is split between Tripoli's government and an internationally-recognized government in the country's east. The UN is trying to broker a deal to unify the two governments. UN envoy for Libya, Bernardino Leon, said late Tuesday that the UN hopes to announce a proposal for a national unity government on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
