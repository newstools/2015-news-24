Dakar - Voters in Congo-Brazzaville have overwhelmingly endorsed a constitutional reform that could pave the way for a third consecutive term for President Denis Sassou Nguesso, the government has said.The reform was backed by nearly 93% of voters in Sunday's referendum, Interior Minister Raymond Mboulou said on television late Monday.The electoral commission put the turnout at 72.4%.But the opposition said there had been a nationwide boycott of the vote and that the turnout could not have been higher than 10%.The constitutional reform will remove age and term limits that prevent Nguesso, 71, from seeking a new term in office in the 2016 elections.Nguesso has ruled Congo-Brazzaville since 1997. He previously served as president between 1979 and 1992.Thousands of Congolese last week clashed with police as they demonstrated against the referendum. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
