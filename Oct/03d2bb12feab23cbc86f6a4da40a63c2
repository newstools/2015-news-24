Petro&rsquo;s husband and two sons leave for Nepal today," spokesperson Nicolize van der Walt said.Nel was on a holiday in Nepal when the light aircraft in which she was a passenger went missing last week Thursday during a sight-seeing flight over a mountainous area.&nbsp;Van der Walt said the search was continuing, but could be affected by a major religious event in the area.&nbsp;"The ground search is continuing today (Thursday). The search team is focusing on a specific area in the woods. The weather plays a huge role in the search and rescue operation."This week was also the start of a nine-day Hindu religious event and this might have a small impact on the search, as some of the search team members might participate in these holy activities," she said.Nel served as a DA ward councillor in the Matlosana municipality in Klerksdorp and earlier this year received the special Paul Harris Rotary Award for her extreme dedication towards community work and upliftment.She was elected DA North West deputy leader on May 25 at the provincial congress in Hartbeespoort Dam near Brits.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
