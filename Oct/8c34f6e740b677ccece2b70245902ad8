Vusi MthalaneUGU District Municipality is to take a tough stance against residents who have illegal water connections on their property.This comes after it was unanimously decided by council in the adoption of the illegal connections policy . The municipality has discovered that our water infrastructure network is being exposed to a wide range of illegal connections which impacts significantly on the municipality s ability to collect revenue, and the adequate supply of water. The policy is meant to enforce punitive measures on those found to have connected water illegally thereby ensuring the reduction of non-revenue water.Illegal water connections are currently costing the municipality a significant amount in revenue while placing our water infrastructure under severe stress. The municipality has over the past months embarked on a water-amnesty campaign on illegal connections. This campaign offers residents, who have their water connected illegally , a chance to disclose this to the municipality in order to regularise the connection through adhering to the stringent conditions that were placed by the municipality .With this policy in place, municipal inspectors have been assigned to enforce the policy provisions on properties that are in transgression of the municipal water connection policy. A fine will be imposed on the properties that are discovered to be consuming our water in an unscrupulous manner and the municipality will thereafter remove the identified illegal connection. Should there be a need for a water connection on the property, payment for the new connection will apply together with all other outstanding water debts before the water supply is restored24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
