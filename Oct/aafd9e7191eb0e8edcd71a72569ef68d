I am not a machine, I was tired, I went home. I woke up around 10:00 and that's when I learnt that of the death of the vazahas." Another suspect, Vavy Louisa, a restaurant manager, said she simply played the role of interpreter for Judalet after five villagers had sought an explanation from him."I wanted to protect Sebastien. He grabbed my arm and begged me, 'Help me madam'," the 39-year-old told the court.If convicted, the suspects, charged with the murder and kidnapping of the trio, could face life behind bars.Marcellin Tomboravo, a sailor who was accused of carrying one of the two Europeans on a cart and of tossing the body into fire, said he was too scared of the mob to not carry out its instruction."I was too scared. I couldn't refuse to carry the vazaha," the 33-year-old said.Judalet and Gianfalla were beaten and torched in front of a crowd of around 100 people, according to images captured by some of the residents.Hours later, the uncle of the missing boy was also killed on the beach, which is renowned for its crystal clear beaches but also notorious for child prostitution.Gianfalla, a former French cook, was living in Madagascar at the time of his death. Judalet worked as a bus driver in France and regularly vacationed in Madagascar.The defendants - including 35 civilians and two policemen - have been charged with a range of offences from murder and kidnapping to vandalism. All have pleaded not guilty.Five of the defendants testified on Monday while 14 gave evidence on Tuesday.The trial continues on Wednesday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
