Nobuhle Qwabe and her four babies have now been transferred back to Benedictine Hospital in Nongoma, where the babies were born exactly a month ago on Tuesday. According to the attending doctor, Nokuthula Mathe, the babies, who have been named Olwethu (the boy), Owam, Owethu and Oliswa, are growing stronger. Two of the girls and the boy now weigh 1,3 kg each, while the other girl weighs 1,4 kg. Soon after their birth, on September 13, 2015, the babies were transferred to a neonatal ICU ward at Lower Umfolozi War Memorial Regional (LUWMR) Hospital — a specialised obstetrics and neonatal facility — for further care. They all returned to the Benedictine Hospital last Wednesday. The pregnancy was described as a miracle as Qwabe admitted at the time that she had not attended antenatal classes during her pregnancy. She said she had only found out that she was carrying quadruplets when they were born and she gave birth naturally. KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo congratulated the young doctors in rural and remote hospitals. “A surprise of quadruplets in a district hospital and so well-managed is a miracle. We wish both the mother and babies a good life,” he said. However, Dlomo also appealed to all pregnant mothers in the province to start antenatal care early for optimal care of both mothers and newborns. — Witness Reporter 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
