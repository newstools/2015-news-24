I plead for Mrs Gigaba and her friends to leave me alone.&ldquo;I don't want to talk about this anymore because I'm now accused of more than just blackmail but [for] being fame hungry too.&ldquo;What's important for me and what I'm fighting for is for Mrs Gigaba to stop degrading me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Mkhize described herself as a buyer for high-end boutiques, celebrity and private clients' stylist and a yoga teacher.An ugly catfight between the two women played out on Instagram last week while the Gigabas, who celebrated their one year wedding anniversary in August, were in Russia. The Gigabas were unavailable for comment.It was reported that Noma sent Mkhize a message on Instagram apparently calling Mkhize a prostitute.&ldquo;Miss photoshop and a lot of makeup awuve ufake [you are fake]. Go to hell, prostitute, tell the world, I am not shaken, loser, you have been doing this since last year,&rdquo; reportedly read one of the messages.Alleged affairSeveral sources told News24 that Mkhize confessed to having an affair with the minister. Mkhize said she was upset that Noma had allegedly called her a prostitute.&ldquo;I am not and have never been a prostitute.&rdquo;Mkhize said she discovered through a mutual friend that Noma had hired a private investigator to investigate her.&ldquo;I therefore challenge her to provide proof that I'm a prostitute... These are very serious allegations.&rdquo;Mkhize said it was not fair to be accused of being plastic.&ldquo;I don't only run a movement that encourages natural fitness, self and skin care, but I also work very hard on my own body.&ldquo;I have been open that I've had a breast reduction and lift because of back problems I had.&rdquo;Mkhize asked Noma to provide proof that she had had surgical procedures.Mkhize also said she had tried very hard to bring peace between her and Noma but instead, Noma allegedly mocked her.&ldquo;[Noma] accused me of trying to befriend her and suck up to her followed by her bringing up past arguments and reasons why we've come to this battle followed by endless insults,&rdquo; said Mkhize.&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never been dumped after a week&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the alleged affair, she said, &ldquo;I've never been dumped by any man after just a week.&ldquo;I don't regret going public because that and legal action, if need be, will hopefully end these insults I've endured even while trying to resolve the matter in private.&rdquo;Mkhize said she did not want to be seen as playing the victim or claiming her innocence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I've contributed very negatively in all this too but have not degraded or insulted her&hellip; This has gone as far as her threatening my life because she has 'power' a ' nobody' like me can't touch.&ldquo;I take that seriously too. Please allow for me to move on with my life, I don't want to keep getting pushed to giving full details that will likely come across as making a mockery of someone's marriage.&rdquo;Mkhize said she apologised to Noma for her conduct.She accused Noma of threatening her.&ldquo;She was calling me a wolf that needs to be 'outed' so that my 'followers ' know the real me. I got tired, hence my going off on social media.&rdquo;Mkhize said she went to the United States as an au pair where she works with the elderly.&ldquo;I've had a heart wrenching struggle building myself up and I'm offended that she keeps calling me uneducated and mostly that she's calling me a prostitute.&ldquo;I've worked very hard to be where I am,&rdquo; said Mkhize.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
