(Matthew 28:18-20)'," Christian Action Network co-ordinator Taryn Hodgson said in a statement."Their approval of homosexual unions will further undermine their ability to reach people for Christ."Last week the church voted, with a majority, in favour of acknowledging homosexual marriage and allowing homosexual ministers to be ordained.&nbsp;The DRC's moderator, Nelis Janse van Rensburg, said the church was doing exactly the opposite of the network's claims and was in fact bringing people closer to Christ.&nbsp;"We are a movement for all people. We are reaching out to every person and we believe in the dignity of every human being," he told News24.&nbsp;"We are expanding our walls to make room for more people, who are also included in the grace and mercy of God. God loves every person. If you exclude people you are going against that."Hodgson said there would be pressure on pastors to perform same-sex civil unions and they could face litigation if they refused.&nbsp;"There will also be further pressure to hire openly homosexual staff at churches, including in children&rsquo;s ministries."Hodgson said "it must be remembered" that congregations were free to decide their stand on the matter.&nbsp;"Our hope and prayer is that many individual congregations will stand firm on the Biblical definition of sin and marriage.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
