If he failed, he would also be disbarred from legal practice."This is an officer of the court who deliberately disobeys a court order. It's not something that this court will take lightly," chief justice Godfrey Chidyausiku was quoted as saying by local media.Tomana would not comment Friday."I am in Russia, let's talk when I am back on the 9th (November)," he told AFP by telephone.The main opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), called for Tomana to resign."He is wholly unfit for purpose, in fact he does not know the purpose of his office i.e. to protect the public from criminals," the MDC said in a statement."The MDC therefore calls upon the prosecutor-general to resign before he does any more harm." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
