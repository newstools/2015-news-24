Cape Town - The government’s official investigation into spy allegations against Advocate Thuli Madonsela, Julius Malema, Lindiwe Mazibuko and Joseph Mathunjwa is “at an advanced stage”. This was the reply from Minister of State Security David Mahlobo to a written parliamentary question from DA Member of Parliament Malcolm Figg. “The investigation of the blog and related matters on the African Intelligence leak is at an advanced stage and the team is expected to conclude the remaining scope of the investigation as soon as possible,” said Mahlobo. Mahlobo announced in March that the State Security Agency, in co-operation with government departments in the security group, had launched an investigation on the basis of spy allegations contained in an anonymous WordPress blog, Africa Inteligence (sic) Leaks. It is not known who the author of this blog – which can be started freely and anonymously by anyone – is. The journal claimed that Madonsela, who is the public protector, is a CIA agent and the CIA had already “begun work” on Economic Freedom Fighters leader Malema in 2010. Mathunjwa, who is the leader of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, allegedly fuelled the mine workers unrest with Malema in order to create a crisis for the ANC. Former DA parliamentary leader, Mazibuko, was alleged to be under Madonsela’s mentorship. All four strongly denied the allegations in March.
