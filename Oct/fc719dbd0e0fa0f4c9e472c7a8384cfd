The 36-year-old sergeant got into an argument with the 32-year-old man at the Maake Plaza on Saturday afternoon, Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesperson Grace Langa said in a statement. During the argument the officer allegedly went to his car, got his gun and shot the man four times. He died on the scene. The victim’s younger brother was shot in the leg when he tried to intervene. The officer was arrested later that day. He was from the Germiston organised crime unit. He would apply for bail in the Maake Magistrate’s Court, where he was facing charges of murder and attempted murder.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
