However, possessing or growing commercial quantities of cannabis is illegal.Ley said medicinal cannabis growers will be licenced and distribution to patients will be controlled to ensure it is safe, legal and sustainable."Allowing the cultivation of legal medicinal cannabis crops in Australia under strict controls strikes the right balance between patient access, community protection and our international obligations," she said.The move is supported by the opposition and is likely to pass through parliament.Most Australian states are keen to embrace the controlled legal cultivation of medicinal cannabis and hope it might become a money-making export crop.Medicinal cannabis is mostly used as an oil rather than smoked.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
