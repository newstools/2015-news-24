	     King William's Town - A man has been arrested after the bodies of two teen sisters were found in an Eastern Cape plantation forest after a traditional ceremony. Police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said the two sisters were believed to have been raped. He said the sisters - Siyamthanda Koli, 12 and Cordelia Koli, 16 - attended a traditional mgidi ceremony on Monday at Mgojweni Location in Ngadu Village, Willowvale. He said the girls apparently left the traditional ceremony at about 02:00 on Tuesday. A mgidi ceremony is a celebration to welcome home males after their coming-of-age initiation. "The bodies of the two girls were spotted by a man at about 06:00 on Tuesday. He saw their bodies in a plantation forest which is about 3km away from the homestead...," he said, adding that the girls' cellphones had also been stolen. Police later arrested a 21-year-old man. The man is expected to appear in the Willowvale Magistrate's Court on Friday on charges of rape, murder and robbery.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
