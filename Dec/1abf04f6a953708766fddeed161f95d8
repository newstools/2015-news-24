Pretoria - For years, South Africa's apartheid government ignored the significance of a "golden rhino" figurine that provides undeniable proof of a sophisticated society existing before white men arrived.But since the end of racist rule in 1994, the stunning object - just 15 millimetres (six inches) long and more than 700 years old - has become a defining symbol of pre-colonial civilisation in South Africa.Described as southern Africa's equivalent of Tutankhamun's mask, the golden foil rhino could be displayed overseas for the first time in the British Museum at an exhibition of South African art late next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The golden rhino.

"The golden rhino is left in limbo."Still, Rassool hopes that before the rhino heads home to Mapungubwe, it first goes on tour to London to be shown to the world."It is important that these aspects of South African culture be known about in as many countries as possible," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
