East London – Another high-ranking Eastern Cape policewoman
has been charged with fraud, forgery and corruption, Hawks spokesperson
Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed on Thursday. Mulaudzi told News24 that Eastern Cape head,
Lieutenant-Colonel Nicole Brown, was the main suspect in their investigation
into police submitting fraudulent travel claims. This comes after Eastern Cape spokesperson Brigadier Marinda
Mills was arrested on December 18 on charges of forgery, corruption and fraud.
The two policewomen will appear together on February 19, at Zwelitsha
Magistrate’s Court near King Williams Town. "We informed her initially that we are investigating
the case. When we arrested Mills, Brown was on leave. Two days after Mills was
arrested, we were informed that Brown had retained legal representation,"
Mulaudzi told News24. He said Brown was formally charged on December 22,
accompanied by her lawyers. Mulaudzi said another policewoman from a different
province was also implicated in their investigation. Her arrest was imminent,
he said. He said police had a zero tolerance policy on issues of
corruption. "We want senior people to lead by example. We cannot
only be targeting the young ones. This serves as a strict warning that issues
of corruption are not tolerated," he said.
