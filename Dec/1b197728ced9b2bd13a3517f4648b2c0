Police at the scene to retrieve the body had to wait for more than two hours for the municipality to disconnect the electricity there. &ldquo;Our guys cannot go into the field because there are live wires everywhere. We need the municipality to switch off the grid so it is safe for us to enter,&rdquo; said a policeman on the scene who cannot be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Tristan Naicker, a resident in a nearby block of flats, said that people are electrocuted &ldquo;almost on a weekly basis&rdquo; by the large number of illegal electrical connections in the area. Msunduzi municipality acting spokesperson Nqobile Madonda said that there were major electrical faults throughout the city this weekend hence the delay in switching off the grid. &ldquo;Municipal teams were out in areas such as Northdale, Hilton, Townbush Road and Copesville due to the many electrical faults over the weekend. &ldquo;We do apologise to the police for the delay.&rdquo; Madonda urged the public to stop making illegal connections.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
