	     Polokwane - Destitute families who benefited from government’s pro-poor housing scheme are facing a major setback after their homes were destroyed by a storm in Limpopo on Monday. The Moreroa family’s home in Kopermyn in Capricorn District was destroyed when heavy rains struck the area. The family had been planning their Christmas holiday when the storm hit, causing their roof to come apart and blow onto a neighbour’s property.  Bricks also gave way and parts of the house collapsed. Welly Moreroa said it would be impossible for them to rebuild their house. They were in urgent need of accommodation. Moreroa said he wanted government to build them another house as their damaged home was not repairable. The family received the house two decades ago as part of a social development programme. Disaster relief funds needed It was unclear if the government would rebuild their home.  MEC for co-operative governance, housing and traditional affairs, Makoma Makhurupetje, had assured them that their house would be rebuilt. However, government needed money from national disaster relief funds to help them, his office said. Polokwane municipality spokesperson, Tidimalo Chuene, said the municipality was working with victims and a report with recommendations would be presented to management. She said the disaster management unit was sent to determine the extent of the damage and what interventions would be needed. In Nzhelele, just outside Makhado, residents affected by the storm blamed government for its slow response to the disaster. No deaths were reported.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
