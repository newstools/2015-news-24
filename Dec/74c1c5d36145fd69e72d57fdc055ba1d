A sudden storm in Howick ripped up part of the Piggly Wiggly’s roof and sent a tree crashing to the ground. The restaurant’s manager, who would not be named, said the storm came “out of the blue” at around 4 pm while a few customers were inside, eating and drinking. She said as soon as part of the roof lifted up, the cafe was flooded with rain water. “There were about seven customers. As soon as the cafe started flooding they helped to clear up the mess,” said the manager. She said it was only after the water had been mopped up that she noticed a large tree had fallen across the road next to Piggly Wiggly. “All the customers and the staff went down to move the tree out of the way. They all helped,” she said. Wiggly Wiggly’s manager added that she was thankful for the customers’ help and that they had successfully managed to clean the cafe up and remove the tree from the road.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
