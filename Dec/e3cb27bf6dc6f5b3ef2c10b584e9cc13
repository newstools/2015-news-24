A local search and rescue official told AFP authorities lost contact with the ship after it encountered high waves and strong winds.However, there was no immediate indication if teams had been dispatched to the scene to locate the ferry's passengers. The Indonesian archipelago of more than 17 000 islands is heavily dependent on ferry services but the industry has a poor safety record and fatal accidents are common.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
