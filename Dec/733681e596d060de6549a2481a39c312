Assembling at the Royal Show Grounds just after sunrise, the mini mob of about 20 picketers marched to the city hall in solidarity with protesters in Johannesburg and Cape Town.Keeping to the pavements, the group &mdash; varying in age, race and gender &mdash; waved placards and chanted for the &ldquo;fall&rdquo; of President Jacob Zuma.Passing motorists hooted at the smiling protesters, raising their thumbs in support.The protest was held early yesterday morning as not to disrupt daily activities and to accommodate those protesters who had to go to work at 8 am.Protest organiser Jen Pretorius, owner of a Tweedie coffee shop owner said even though the turnout was tiny, the sentiment for the protest was immense.&ldquo;I am here because I have never wanted to be a person who bad-mouths the country, but in the past few months my eyes have been opened and I am seriously worried about our beautiful country,&rdquo; Pretorius said.&ldquo;Enough is enough. We are not idiots and we should not be treated like we are.&rdquo;Another picketer, Kerry Fourie, called for unity in the bid for Zuma to be removed from office.&ldquo;You do not have the right to complain unless you stand up for what you believe in, so all the people sitting at home complaining about our government and our president really need to stand together,&rdquo; Fourie said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
