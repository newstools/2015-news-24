The outbreak was detected on December 8 within the disease protection zone, which borders the Kruger National Park in Limpopo. Vaccinations began on December 14, targeting a total of  6 070 cattle. "Fourteen cattle are showing signs of the disease with a total of 1 200 cattle at risk, because the cattle all use the same dipping facility," said national agriculture spokesperson Bomikazi Molapo. The disease affects only one dipping tank, which is in Matiani, and would not affect exports, Molapo said. Buffalo from the Kruger National Park are believed to have spread the disease as they vie with cattle for limited grazing and water resources during current drought conditions. Foot and mouth disease spreads easily among cloven-hoofed animals and can lead to lameness and even death. The disease is not fatal in humans.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
