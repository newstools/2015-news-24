Cape Town - The body of a teenager presumed to have drowned in Strand has still not been found, the National Sea Rescue Institute said on Friday afternoon. The search for the 17-year-old resumed this morning with a police helicopter and dive unit, as well as the NSRI continuing their operation. The teen, from Eersteriver, disappeared underwater after getting into difficulty while swimming on Thursday, NSRI Gordons Bay deputy station commander Edward Russouw said. A sea rescue craft and swimmers were dispatched while a rescue helicopter, police, government emergency medical services, the Law Enforcement Marine Unit, Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services and a Police Dive Unit also responded. A friend had tried unsuccessfully to rescue him. "A K-9 search and rescue team joined the search efforts and the Law Enforcement Marine Unit launched a rescue jet-ski to assist the NSRI sea rescue craft searching," he said on Thursday. "An extensive air, sea and shore search has revealed no sign of the missing teenager who is presumed to have drowned." The family is receiving trauma counselling.
