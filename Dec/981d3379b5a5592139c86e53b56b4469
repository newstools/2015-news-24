Durban – A KwaZulu-Natal Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs employee appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court for allegedly embezzling R7.5m, the department said on Friday. KwaZulu-Natal Cogta MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said Patricia Nokwazi Chule, who has since resigned, was released on R50 000 bail. Chule, who is due back in court in February 2016, is expected to report at the Plessislaer police station three times a week. "She was allegedly nabbed by the Hawks at the home of the businessman who was arrested last week and also released on R50 000 bail," Dube-Ncube said. Dude-Ncube said the official allegedly bypassed a complex departmental security payment system and managed to send a payment to an account linked to the businessman instead of to the Ingwe Municipality. "Fraud and corruption cause a lot of damage to service delivery and the betterment of community lives. "We trust the courts will, in this case, send a clear message that fraud and corruption do not pay," she said.
