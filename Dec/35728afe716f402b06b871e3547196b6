"Furthermore, that the rights to basic education and equality are individual rights to which every learner is entitled. Education is a vehicle for the fulfillment of the right to equality. "The judgment further confirms that the right to basic education is not subject to progressive realisation but should receive immediate attention," a statement read.The SCA announced their judgment against Motshekga and the Limpopo Provincial Department of Basic Education (DBE) on Wednesday.The SCA said, "The law is clear&hellip; The DBE is obliged to provide a textbook to every learner to ensure compliance with s 29(1)(a) of the Constitution. We must guard against those who are most vulnerable. In this case we are dealing with the rural poor and with children. They are deserving of Constitutional protection."&nbsp;The Commission said it participated in both the High Court and the SCA proceedings. "The Commission&rsquo;s participation was motivated by its constitutional and statutory mandate to promote the respect, protection and monitoring of human rights in South Africa. The Commission had earlier investigated and convened hearings on the procurement and delivery of textbooks nationally," said Commission spokesperson Isaac Mangena.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
