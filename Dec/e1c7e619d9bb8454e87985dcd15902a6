"People misunderstood what I was saying. I said once an idea has taken hold, you cannot destroy that idea..."You may destroy the people that carry the idea on the battlefield, but, ultimately, it is not the end of the story."Recent weeks have seen a wave of protests calling for the release of the London-based director of Radio Biafra Nnamdi Kanu, who is also head of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) pressure group.He has pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal conspiracy and intimidation, and belonging to a banned organisation. He remains in the custody of Nigeria's secret police.The protests also saw calls for a separate state of Biafra, 45 years on from the end of a brutal civil war sparked by the declaration of an independent republic in 1967.Around one million died of the effects of war, starvation and illness.DetainedSoyinka himself was arrested and detained for almost two years by Nigeria's then-military regime over his alleged interaction with the Biafra leadership under General Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu.The novelist and playwright said Nigeria's civilian government now needed to talk to pro-Biafra activists, most of them ethnic Igbos who complain of being marginalised since the end of the conflict."Ask what are those things we can do to make you content, to make you feel part of this entity [Nigeria]... what can we do to make them feel that they belong and are not alienated?" he said."Listen to some other Biafrans and ask them why they want to stay."But, don't go around saying 'the sovereignty of this country is indivisible, this won't happen under my watch, it is not negotiable'. That type of language would only make matters worse."Police have sent reinforcements to the southeast because of the protests and vowed anyone threatening Nigeria's sovereignty would "face the full wrath of the law".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
