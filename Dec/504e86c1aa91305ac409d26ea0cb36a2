	     Five provinces have been declared drought disaster areas, threatening food security in the country.WATCH Mahikeng - Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane has handed over six water tankers valued at R7.8m to the drought-stricken North West government. The tanker trucks were delivered to Premier Supra Mahumapelo on Thursday for distribution across the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality, which borders Botswana, as part of an intervention by her department. "These trucks are much cheaper compared to what government is spending on tenders for water tankering," Mokonyane said. She said that since the tankers were state-owned assets, the North West government would use them as part of its water provision plan, while at the same time working with the national department to find sustainable solutions to water problems in the province. She urged communities and government officials to look after the trucks and guard against vandalism. She said more water tankers would be delivered next year. Premier Mahumapelo said he hoped no one would disrupt the operation of the trucks. Newly appointed Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs David van Rooyen and Executive Mayor of the Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality Justice Makolomakwa attended the handing over ceremony. The trucks were immediately dispatched to the municipality after the event.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
