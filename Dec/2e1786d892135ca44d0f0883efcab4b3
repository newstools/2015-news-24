Hargey, an Oxford University professor, opened the mosque on Lester Road in September 2014 and welcomed women, homosexuals, and non-Muslims to prayers. This resulted in much criticism from traditional Muslims who felt he was violating the tenets of the faith. The mosque was attacked at least twice.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
