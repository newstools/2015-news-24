The march, dubbed the river of tears march, was organised by the ANC Woman's League and was aimed at commemorating the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign.Jayde Panayiotou&nbsp;was abducted outside her Kabega Park townhouse complex in April this year. Her body was found on a farm in Rocklands near Uitenhage the next day.&nbsp; Her husband Christopher has been charged with orchestrating her murder and is currently awaiting trial.Port Elizabeth model Reeva Steenkamp was gunned down by Paralympian Oscar Pistorius through a closed toilet door in his Pretoria home early on Valentine&rsquo;s Day in 2013. Last week saw Judge Thokozile Masipa's judgment of culpable homicide against Pistorius overturned and he was found guilty of murder.The group of about 200 people, which included Reeva's parents June and Barry Steenkamp, Jayde's parents Michelle and Derick Inggs and her sister Toni, marched from Shark Rock Pier at Hobie Beach shortly after 17:00 and ended at Pollock Beach, where Reeva Steenkamp's ashes were previously scattered.Also among the people present was Freddie Sithole, father of Tshepiso, a first-year NMMU student who was found dead in her Summerstrand student residence in 2011. The Inggs, Steenkamp and Sithole families made their way down to the beach, where prayers were said and then lit candles in memory of the daughters they had lost to violent crime, before returning to the parking lot and addressing the people who had joined the walk.Speaking on the loud hailer, Reeva&rsquo;s mother, June, said she was grateful to those who had come out to support the cause. "Thank you for supporting us in trying to get some closure after what happened to us.&nbsp; There are many people here today who have lost their children and that&rsquo;s exactly what this is all about, she said.ANCWL Deputy President, Jacqui Mofokeng thanked the people for coming out and showing their support."This march restores hope to multitudes of cases of violence against women that fell within the cracks of the justice system that justice can be served and it must be served to all," she said."We remain resolute as women to galvanise and support all women and children who have been abused. We stand by all victims ,women must speak out and protect their children," she said.(Pictures supplied by News24 Correspondent)24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
