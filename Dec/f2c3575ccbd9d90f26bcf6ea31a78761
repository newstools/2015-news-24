  Johannesburg - Four men have been arrested in possession of
suspected stolen property valued at around R42 000 in Tarlton, police said on

off about a white Mazda double cab bakkie on its way to deliver suspected
stolen goods at a house in the Norman informal settlement, police spokesperson
Constable Lucky Matome said. The officers responded and were able to arrest the four, who
were aged between 27 and 47. The men were found in possession of 11 cellphone tower
