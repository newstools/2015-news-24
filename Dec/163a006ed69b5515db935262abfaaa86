El-Muqadam's statement also says the committee is "continuing its work."The 31 October crash killed all 224 people onboard. Russia has said an explosive device had been placed onboard the Airbus 321-200 and the Sinai branch of the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
