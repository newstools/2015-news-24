Children are walking alone, often without telling their parents, to other countries, to avoid lives of perpetual forced labour on low pay with no education or work opportunities," Kagari said."That they choose to undertake such precarious and unsafe journeys to supposed safe havens reflects the gravity of the human rights violations they would face if they stayed at home."'Defend its independence'Under Eritrean law, conscription is limited to 18 months, but Asmara says it has to rely on its people to defend it from Ethiopia, from whom it broke away from in 1991 after a brutal 30-year independence struggle, before returning to war in 1998-2000.Troops still eyeball each other along the frontier, with Ethiopian soldiers defying an international ruling to leave Eritrean land.Eritrea was "left with no other choice but to rely on its population to defend its independence and sovereignty," Asmara said in June.The Amnesty report, based on interviews with 72 Eritreans who fled the country since mid-2014, said Asmara's change of policy was just rhetoric."There have been no discernible changes... conscription into National Service continues to be extended indefinitely and conscripts continue to be deployed in a range of civilian as well as military roles," the report read. "The system therefore continues to amount to forced labour, in violation of international law."Sending Eritreans back would see them locked up in dire conditions at home, Amnesty added."Those who try to escape are arbitrarily detained," the report read."The same fate would likely befall those forcibly returned from overseas upon the rejection of their asylum applications."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
