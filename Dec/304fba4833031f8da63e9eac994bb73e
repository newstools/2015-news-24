And the body has admitted that there were a number of cases of group copying during the department&rsquo;s &shy;matric exams in four provinces.Umalusi Council chairperson &shy;Professor John Volmink told reporters in Pretoria that a total of 26 alleged &shy;cases of group copying were reported in Gauteng (6), KwaZulu-Natal (12), Limpopo (1) and Mpumalanga (7).&ldquo;This year has seen a number of new schools being implicated in group copying. We also acknowledge the &shy;significant reduction in the number of &shy;alleged cases of group copying &shy;compared to 2014. It is worth noting that detection of these irregularities &shy;attests to a very functional and vigilant system,&rdquo; said Volmink.Results from the affected centres won&rsquo;t be released as investigations are still ongoing.&ldquo;We want to extend a serious &shy;warning to those who are implicated that drastic measures will be taken against them,&rdquo; he said.Volmink said Umalusi was &shy;concerned about the leakage of exam papers and called for harsher &shy;punishment for guilty parties. &shy;Problems were encountered in &shy;Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga.The leakage started in Limpopo and spilled into the two other provinces, compromising both Life Sciences &shy;papers.&ldquo;Umalusi is very concerned about this trend and takes the view that strong action must be taken against those &shy;pupils and officials who have made themselves guilty of these acts of &shy;dishonesty,&rdquo; Volmink said. &ldquo;Umalusi will therefore not approve the release of the results of all the &shy;identified culprits in the Vhembe &shy;District, Gauteng and Mpumalanga. The investigation is still continuing.&rdquo;Nineteen candidates in the Vhembe District, three candidates in &shy;Mpumalanga, and four candidates in Gauteng were implicated in the leakage.&ldquo;There are a number of factors that affected this year&rsquo;s pupil &shy;performance, which we hope we can correct,&rdquo; said Volmink. He said the poorer performance could be due to the high standards of this year&rsquo;s papers, but they could not compromise on the quality of &shy;education, he said. &ldquo;The standard of the papers improved and catered for more challenging questions as &shy;compared to 2014. The standards of the papers might have contributed to the &shy;performance, but the standards can&rsquo;t be dropped just to push up the pass rate,&rdquo; Volmink said. &ldquo;Umalusi can&rsquo;t lower the bar for standards. They can only be &shy;improved in the classroom.&rdquo; The results will be released on January 5, 2016. The Department of Basic Education said it would only comment in January on Umalusi&rsquo;s announcement.&ldquo;We are only releasing the results on the fifth of January so we don&rsquo;t want to pre-empt any of these &shy;announcements. We will comment when minister pronounces,&rdquo; said department spokesperson Troy Martens. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga announced in January that 28 exam centres in KwaZulu-Natal and 16 in the Eastern Cape would be &shy;investigated after evidence of group copying was found. Pupils submitted the same answers to questions.In February, Umalusi CEO Mafu &shy;Rakometsi said pupils had answers &shy;dictated to them. He said in one case whoever gave the dictation to pupils said &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; and pupils wrote &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; on their answer sheets.The 2014 cheating scandal has yet to be fully resolved. &mdash; Witness Reporter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
