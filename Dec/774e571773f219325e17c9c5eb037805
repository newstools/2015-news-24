This was because the matter had been referred to the office of the Western Cape Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for a decision on whether to proceed with the case, said National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson for the region, Eric Ntabazalila. "It will only be enrolled once a decision has been taken," he said, but did not offer reasons for why it was referred. A court official confirmed the docket was on its way to the DPP. Gibbs was facing charges of driving under the influence of alcohol. He was initially due to make his first court appearance at the end of last month. However, he was out of the country at the time and the matter was not placed on the roll. A year ago, a report emerged that Gibbs had been arrested in Cape Town. Western Cape police could not confirm his identity at the time, but said a 40-year-old man was arrested following a car accident on November 30 last year. He was granted bail. He had allegedly been speeding when he collided with a Toyota. In 2009, Gibbs was treated at a rehabilitation clinic for drug and alcohol abuse. In March 2008 he was arrested on Main Road, Sea Point, in Cape Town and charged with drunken driving, alternatively reckless or negligent driving. The charges were withdrawn. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
