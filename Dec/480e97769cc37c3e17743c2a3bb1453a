A number of marches in support of the &ldquo;Zuma Must Fall&rdquo; campaign are expected to take place nationwide today, with thousands expected to take to the streets demanding the axing of President Jacob Zuma.Closer to home, a local businesswoman has taken the initiative to rally Pietermaritzburg residents to support the campaign, using Facebook to draw awareness to the march.The march is due to start from 6 am today outside the Royal Show Grounds with the group proceeding to the city hall.Tweedie coffee shop owner Jen Pretorius said the idea came about after the plummeting exchange rate resulted in her business&rsquo;s sales dropping.&ldquo;I never wanted to be one to complain but for the past three months, my eyes have opened to what is going on in our country and it scared me,&rdquo; Pretorius said.&ldquo;I am not looking for any political reaction, the idea came about to rally other concerned citizens after my sales dropped and show support to our fellow citizens also marching [today]&rdquo;.According to Pretorius, the Msunduzi Municipality did not support the march, and instead said the protesters would be arrested if they took to the roads.To evade arrest, Pretorius said the group will march on the pavements.&ldquo;There might be 10, 100 or 1 000 people who will attend [today], I am not sure.&rdquo;Acting spokesperson for the Msunduzi Municipality Nqobile Madonda said council has not received any application for a march to take place today.&ldquo;In fact I am not sure who the marchers will hand over their memorandum to because it is a public holiday and council is in recess,&rdquo; said Madonda.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
