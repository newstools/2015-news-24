The Daily Monitor quoted the academic as saying the opposition parties, particularly the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) led by&nbsp; Kizza Besigye, and Independent candidate Amama Mbabazi stood a good chance of winning the elections next year, but it would be futile because the country would be led &nbsp;into a bloodbath as Museveni&rsquo;s ruling party the NRM unleashes violence. &ldquo;I do not believe that any Opposition candidate in Uganda today can win this election, which is highly in favour of the incumbency&hellip; [If that happens], then you will have chaos or a military coup,&rdquo; Prof Oloka-Onyango was quoted saying. According to a Guardian report many Ugandans would shun the elections as the electorate believed that they would not lead to any fundamental change in the country.

According to a human rights NGO director Livingstone Sewanyana, most Ugandans had lost hope, saying that they no longer believed elections would change their lives. &ldquo;There is still no adequate healthcare, people&rsquo;s incomes have not improved and unemployment is still problematic, but then elections always retain the same old leadership and this has made some Ugandans see voting as a waste of time,&rdquo; said Sewanyana.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
