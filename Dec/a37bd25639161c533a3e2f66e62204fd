"The house has since been demolished," he added. On Saturday, Shiite faithful blocked the main road outside their Husseiniyya religious centre, where hundreds had gathered for a ceremony.The crowds obstructed traffic, including the convoy of Nigeria army chief Tukur Yusuf Buratai, witnesses and the military said.The military claimed the Shi'ites attacked Buratai, which left soldiers no option but to retaliate.The army said IMN members, who set barricades and bonfires on the road, were armed with "dangerous weapons" in a "deliberate attempt to assassinate the chief of army staff and members of his entourage"."The troops responsible for the safety and security of the Chief of Army Staff on hearing explosion and firing were left with no choice than to defend him and the convoy at all cost as well as open up the barricaded road for law abiding citizens," it added. Buratai was on an official visit to the city, the statement issued late on Saturday said. IMN spokesman Musa, however, said there was "no reason" for opening fire and the group was made up of "defenceless people out to perform a religious ceremony".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
