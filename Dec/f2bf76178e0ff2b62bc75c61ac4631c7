Both France and the UN have denied there was a cover-up, but a UN official who leaked the report to the French government in mid-2014 was temporarily suspended for disclosing the information. French and UN peacekeepers were sent to CAR in late 2013 after the country descended into sectarian violence, leaving thousands dead and some 900 000 displaced.The UN mission has been hit by 13 cases of alleged sexual abuse by its peacekeepers, including nine that involve underage victims as young as 11, an official said in August.Another sexual assault case emerged the following month when a teenage girl accused a French soldier of raping and impregnating her. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
