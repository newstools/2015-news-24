General Richard Kasonga, spokesperson for the Congolese army, told The Associated Press on Friday that suspect Ladislas Ntaganzwa is currently being held by security forces in the eastern town of Goma. Ntaganzwa was arrested four days ago in the DRC's North Kivu province. Congolese officials have released few details about the arrest other than to say that he did not resist and it took place after they had dismantled his rebel group's headquarters in the area. The perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide fled across the border into eastern Congo afterward, where Congolese authorities say they have wreaked havoc ever since. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
