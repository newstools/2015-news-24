Cellphones, blades, drugs and counterfeit CDs and DVDs were among items seized during a raid at Wellington Prison in Mthatha, Eastern Cape police said on Sunday. The blades found are believed to be linked to prison violence, said Lieutenant Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela."Sometimes when they are fighting, they are using the blades."Fatyela said that the raid – a joint operation by correctional services officials and police that began on Friday and continued over the weekend – also uncovered 97 cellphones and various quantities of dagga, tik powder and mandrax.Fake CDs and DVDS were also confiscated.Fatyela said that it was difficult to take action against the prisoners because whenever they saw officials coming, "they just push the items away" to avoid being caught in possession of the contraband.He said, however, an investigation was underway. Further raids were also planned. Dalindyebo has to hand himself over on Wednesday to start serving a term at the prison after being convicted on charges of culpable homicide, kidnapping, arson, assault and defeating the ends of justice.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
