Bridget.Siebert AS a matter of urgency, refuse collection must be privatised as we are now experiencing on a daily basis, filth and garbage in all areas, be it in commercial or residential areas. Privatising the entire refuse system will most definitely alleviate this major problem we are facing. The present strike is totally out of control. Litter is strewn on the streets of our so-called City of Choice and also in all the suburban areas because the Msunduzi Municipality’s trucks have not been in operation to collect the household garbage for the past five days, causing a terrible stench that could result in the spread of disease. It is time that the municipal manager, Mxolisi Nkosi, steps in and resolves the burning matter as soon as possible regarding the workers’ demands. The irony of the whole thing is that all the households will receive their next municipal bill with the full charge for refuse collection without any rebate on uncollected refuse. Kindly give priority to this ugly situation before it becomes volatile. A.S.E. AMEEN Mountain Rise Pietermaritzburg  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
