In October 1987, he was murdered in a coup that brought Compaore to power.Read this: Ghost of 'Africa's Che Guevara'Sankara's murder is one of the most high-profile killings in Africa's post-independence history and the charge against Diendere could represent a breakthrough in a case that has haunted the West African country for decades.It follows a pledge by the transitional government to investigate the murder and a decision in May to exhume the remains of a body believed to be Sankara's, which was buried at a cemetery on the outskirts of the capital Ouagadougou.Diendere was Compaore's intelligence chief and right-hand man. In September, he led the presidential guard in a short-lived coup in which soldiers took transitional President Michel Kafando and the prime minister hostage.The coup failed and in its aftermath, the presidential guard was disbanded and Diendere sought refuge at the Vatican embassy. He was then arrested and charged with murder and threatening state security. He is still in detention.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
