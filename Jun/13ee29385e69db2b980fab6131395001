The group has since launched the People First movement also known as the Original Zanu PF.Last week, Mujuru openly told Mugabe that she could never be expelled from the &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; Original Zanu PF, while also openly querying for the first time the mysterious death of her husband, General Solomon Mujuru, whose remains were found after a fire at their Beatrice farm in 2011.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
