The arrests came after a team from the KwaDukuza cluster worked around the clock since Johnson and his brother Ian Johnson were attacked. A group of gunmen, understood to have been armed with assault rifles, opened fire on the two as they stood in their driveway. Johnson was felled by a shot to the chest and despite being shot in the face and foot, Ian clambered into the farmhouse where he, along with his wife Cheryl, barricaded themselves inside an office. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker said the team had worked around the clock for the past two days. “They have taken in two suspects for questioning in the early hours of this morning. A 42-year-old man and a 53-year-old woman are in custody and detectives are on the trail of the outstanding suspects,” he said. Community Safety MEC Willies Mchunu said he was disgusted by the attack. “We welcome these two arrests because it sends a clear message the police will always catch up to suspects," he said. “We urge the police to continue with their investigation so the remaining suspects involved in this diabolical deed will be apprehended and sent to jail. “We are again calling on whoever might have information in this matter to share it with the police immediately so further arrests can be made and a conviction and sentence can be secured." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
