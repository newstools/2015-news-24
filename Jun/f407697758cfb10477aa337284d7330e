Moses Maleka was shot several times while sitting in a car in the early hours of Sunday morning, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said. “He was taken to hospital by a friend, where he died.” No arrests had been made. Maleka was out on bail at the time. Maleka, Bafana Mthembu, and Benson Mbatha were arrested in July 2011 for several housebreakings and robberies in the Sandton area. At the time, Pretoria Regional Court Magistrate Anton Klopper ordered them released as police had failed to bring them to court within the required 48 hours. They were however immediately rearrested on another charge. They became known as the Rolex gang for allegedly following people home and then robbing them of jewellery and other valuables. Dlamini did not know the progress of the case and asked for questions to be sent to him in writing. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
