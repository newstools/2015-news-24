	     Accra - Authorities say at least 73 people are dead after an explosion at a gas station in Ghana's capital. Billy Anaglate, a spokesperson for Ghana Fire Service, said that crews were still recovering bodies early on Thursday at the scene. The cause of the overnight explosion was not immediately known but neighbours said that many people had taken shelter at the station amid torrential rains and flooding. Michael Plange, who lives a few blocks away, told The Associated Press that many people were under a shed at the time of the explosion and got trapped. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
