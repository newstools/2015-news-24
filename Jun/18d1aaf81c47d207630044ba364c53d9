with the rape of a jogger in Howick in the KZN Midlands after a five-day
manhunt. Police spokesperson Colonel Jay Naicker
said the suspect, 25, was arrested on Wednesday after an around the clock
investigation by the Howick Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual
Offences Unit. “Following an investigation by the FCS Unit,
a suspect was eventually traced and arrested. The suspect is expected to appear
in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court soon,” he said. The victim, an accomplished businesswoman,
had been on a morning run on the Curry’s Post Road, a popular route for runners
and cyclists. News24 reported on Wednesday that the woman
would be returning home to Johannesburg following days spent recuperating. The incident has shaken the close-knit
community of Howick to its core, and cast doubt over the safety of the Curry’s
Post area, a popular spot for trail runners and cyclists. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
