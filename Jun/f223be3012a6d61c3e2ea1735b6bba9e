Its nearly 500-page report released in early June details how the country, under Isaias Afwerki's iron-fisted regime for the past 22 years, has created a repressive system in which people are routinely arrested at whim, detained, tortured, killed or go missing.Final and extra-ordinary conclusionsAsmara said the report was filled with "bias, errors, unsubstantiated and illogical claims, misrepresentations and evidentiary weaknesses that are used to reach final and extraordinary conclusions".Eritrea, which broke away from Ethiopia in 1991 after a brutal 30-year independence struggle, remains in a tense stand off with Addis Ababa after a 1998-2000 border war. Troops still eyeball each other along the frontier, with Ethiopian soldiers defying an international ruling to leave Eritrean land."By law national service is only required for 18 months," Eritrea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said."However, due to Ethiopia's refusal to abide by a final and binding ruling, and the international community's continued indifference to this deliberate flaunting of international law by Ethiopia, the government of Eritrea had been left with no other choice but to rely on its population to defend its independence and sovereignty."Eritrea, which denied investigators entry to the country, also criticised the evidence as "emanating from self-described "human rights activists" with an "openly declared regime-change agenda".It also rejected accusations its leadership could be guilty of possible war crimes."There is no evidentiary support for the claim," Asmara said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
