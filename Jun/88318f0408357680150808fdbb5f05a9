Emily Kachote, 25, has shown "immoral behaviour", the Miss Zimbabwe Trust said in a statement. Some Zimbabweans complained Kachote was "ugly" when she won the Miss World Zimbabwe contest in April. "The Miss Zimbabwe executive board would like to inform the nation that it has decided to dethrone Miss Emily Kachote as Miss World Zimbabwe 2015," the statement said. "Being in a relationship, sexual advances to anyone and any behaviour categorised as immoral by the Miss Zimbabwe Trust is grounds for instant disqualification and dethronement," the statement added. Kachote, a financial advisor, had admitted the pictures, apparently leaked by an ex, were genuine. She said she'd hoped the man had deleted the pictures. Last year's Miss Zimbabwe Thabiso Phiri was also caught up in a nude photo scandal. The Trust insists she resigned of her own accord. "I wonder if they will even find a Miss Zimbabwe next year?" a reader of the official Herald online commented. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
