"The SG should be encouraging the federation to unite the workers across the board, instead of encouraging competition."Nehawu said it was regrettable that Mantashe had "fallen victim" to what it called a perpetuated myth that workers' employment sectors could be used as a yardstick to measure their level of consciousness."Public sector workers face the same challenges as those confronting the industrial workers. "This unfortunate statement is also flawed because it, unintentionally, paints the state as a better devil compared to capital and ignores its hierarchical, exploitative and coercive nature," Nehawu said.It said public sector unions were leading the working class struggles."The argument by the SG to demonise public sector unions is equivalent to the neoliberal logic perpetuated by Treasury that treats the public servants' salaries as expenditure, instead of investment. "They both relegate the public sector workers to the bottom end of the priority pyramid."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
