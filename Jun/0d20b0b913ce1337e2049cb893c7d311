girl who was forced into marriage at 13 in Nigeria and admitted killing her
husband and three friends with rat poison has been ordered freed. Her
lawyer convinced a prosecutor to drop demands for the death sentence, according
to the lawyer. A judge in Gezawa ordered Wasila Tasi'u freed on Monday. Lawyer
Hussaina Aliyu Ibrahim says she fears for her clients' safety in a community
that believes she is getting away with murder. She says returning the girl, now
14, to her conservative Muslim family will just consign her to another forced
marriage. Tasi'u could be freed on Wednesday. Another
child bride condemned to death at 13 for killing her husband remains on death
row, a year after a West African court ruled her sentencing illegal. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
