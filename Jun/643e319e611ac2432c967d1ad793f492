THREE people were arrested after police raided a house in Phutanang, that was reportedly used as a chop shop where stolen motorcycles are stripped. The arrest of two women, aged 51 and 27, and a man (32) was carried out on Thursday (11/06) when the SAPS Crime Intelligence, Galeshewe Cluster Task Team, K9 unit, Kimberley Flying Squad and the Vehicle Identification Section raided a house in Phutanang Galeshewe after a tip-off. The police received information about the house in Thandi Classen Street. According to Lt Olebogeng Tawana, the police found numerous parts of dismantled motorcycles that had already been packaged and were ready for shipment. It is believed these stolen parts were to be taken out of South Africa through the borders to an unnamed destination. The case follows after two suspects were arrested by the Kimberley Flying Squad on Tuesday (09/06) after they were apprehended and detained by members of the neighbourhood watch in Cassandra who suspected them of being in possession of stolen property. The neighbourhood watch noticed a blue Toyota Kombi driving down the street. Its lights were off. “The members followed the vehicle into town and managed to pull them off the road at the corner of Quinn and Phakamile Mabija Road. “It is alleged that two of the four suspects jumped out of the vehicle and fled the scene. Two men were found inside the vehicle. The Kombi had no seats and a stolen Black Big Boy CC250 scooter was found inside,” stated Lt Sergio Kock in an earlier report. Police also confiscated numerous number plates stripped from the stolen motorcycles. According to Tawana, the two suspects who were arrested on Tuesday appeared in court on Thursday (11/06). The case was remanded to Wednesday (17/06) for further investigation. “The three suspects arrested last night will be appearing in court soon, also on charges of possession of suspected stolen property,” Tawana said
