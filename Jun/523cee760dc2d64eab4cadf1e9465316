Five were shot and wounded on Wednesday, according to witnesses.50 journalists fled countryThe United Nations' top envoy for Burundi on Thursday quit as mediator in the crisis, after his role was challenged by civil society leaders, who questioned his impartiality."Said Djinnit gave up his role as mediator in the Burundian crisis, but he will return to Bujumbura as the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region," said Vladimir Monteiro, spokesperson for the UN mission in Burundi. No information was given as to a possible successor as mediator.Djinnit appealed to all sides "to refrain from any acts likely to increase tension and violence" in a statement, urging they "continue their dialogue".The UN this week warned that increasing violence by a pro-government militia, including executions, abductions and torture, was threatening to further destabilise the poverty-stricken, landlocked country."They could tip an already extremely tense situation over the edge," UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a statement on Tuesday."The last thing Burundi needs after a decade of gradual and largely successful peace-building is to be catapulted back into civil war because of a small number of people's ruthless determination to retain, or gain, power at any cost."Rights group Amnesty International said this week that Burundian journalists were operating in a "climate of fear", while Reporters Without Borders said on Thursday that some 50 journalists had fled the country "for security reasons and say it is still too dangerous to go back".Parliamentary elections are now slated for June 29 and a presidential poll on July 15, after delays due to the unrest.Burundi's opposition, which has said that fair polls are not possible because independent media has been shut down and many opponents have fled the country, have accused the president of trying to force a vote regardless of the crisis.Nkurunziza survived a coup attempt last month and has since faced down international pressure, including aid cuts, aimed at forcing him to reconsider his attempt to stay in power, which diplomats fear could plunge the country back into war.The elections are also going ahead despite a string of resignations by election commission officials. On Wednesday Nkurunziza issued another decree allowing the remaining three out of five members of the commission, which had been paralysed by two resignations, to take majority decisions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
