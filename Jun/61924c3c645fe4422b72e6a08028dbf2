The Western Cape Canoe ­Union’s (WCCU) two-day K1 canoe race, the Pink Lady Drakenstein, held on the Berg River last weekend, was hosted this year by the Paarl Canoe Club under the leadership of both chairperson Eric Farringer and the Pink Lady’s Rob Meihuizen. It was a well organised event with some 150 paddlers taking part. Notwithstanding the minimal rainfall that the Western Cape had received before the start of the race, the Berg River was running very low – so much so that the planned first day of racing from Paarl to Hermon (45km), was changed to a route from Gouda Bridge to Bridgehouse (30 km). The second planned day of paddling also changed from a start on the Berg River dam and end in Paarl (21 km) to a route from Paarl to Skooltjie near Wellington (23 km). The race was won by Peninsula Canoe Club’s Brandon van der Walt. Given the success of this event, there is no doubt that WCCU will call upon Paarl Canoe Club to repeat the success again next year.
