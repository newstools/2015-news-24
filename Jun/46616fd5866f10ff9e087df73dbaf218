The science has limits and sharia is the basis of everything," said Ismaila Ndiaye, an imam.But fellow Muslim cleric Khadim Rassoul Gueye argued that it was time to "use science for better accuracy"."Sharia will not change one iota. It is for us to adapt," said Gueye, who is responsible for calculating prayers times and the lunar calendar at the mosque in the capital's Point E neighbourhood.'God is omniscient'An estimated 90-95 percent of Senegalese are estimated to be Muslim, and Islamic practice takes the form of membership of one of four Sufi brotherhoods led by a "marabout", or Koranic teacher.Each of these - the larger Tijaniyyah and Muridiyyah orders, the pan-Islamic Qadiriyyah and the smaller Layene - instruct their followers on the start of Ramadan after studying the skies with the naked eye, adding to the background noise."In Senegal, it is the families that give the 'ndigel' to fast," said Ndiaye, using the word for "order" in the local Wolof language."Each family has its own committee to which its followers refer."A CONACOCC member told AFP on condition of anonymity that Senegal's most senior marabouts were in agreement that this was the proper way to do things."This is what the Prophet did. This is the way we still do things," he said."In the days of the prophet Mohammed, such tools as the telescope and the mobile phone did not exist," he went on."But God is omniscient and knew all this and asked for observation to be performed with the naked eye. Astronomical calculations bring problems and Muslim scientists have rejected them."But Ahmed Kante, chairman of the Forum of Knowledge and Values, a secular association, said differences have existed since the first generations of Muslims argued over the start of the lunar month, the use of technology and astronomical calculations."Resistance to change is not peculiar to Senegal. It is a problem of education, culture and even politics," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
