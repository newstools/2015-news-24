Motherwell police spokesperson, Warrant Officer Dumile Gwavu, said the woman was withdrawing money from an ATM at the Ziyabuya Shopping Complex yesterday when two men approached her and allegedly tried to rob her. "The one man grabbed her bag and tried to run off with it, but she struggled with him and a passer-by who saw what was going on came to assist her," Gwavu said. Gwavu said when the 42-year-old man approached, the bag snatcher's accomplice allegedly drew a firearm and shot the man in the hand. The man then drew his own firearm and gave chase, allegedly shooting one of the suspects numerous times. Gwavu said the suspected robber who had been shot fell down and died at the scene from his injuries. He said the other man got away. Gwavu said the man and woman had both been taken to hospital after the incident. The woman was treated for shock and the man for a gunshot wound to the hand. He said a case of robbery was being investigated by the police. The second suspect had not yet been arrested. He said the National Prosecuting Authority would have to decide whether they would be bringing any charges against the man for shooting the alleged robber. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
