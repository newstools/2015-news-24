It was about the restoration of the dignity of black people. It was about ensuring that black people occupy leadership responsibility through quality education,&rdquo; he said.'Afrikaans is still supreme'Malema said signs of oppression still lingered, citing what he perceived as the dominance of the Afrikaans language.&ldquo;Today when you write examinations at Unisa, the question paper is written in English and Afrikaans, and that what the youth of 1976 says they didn&rsquo;t want, it is still dominating.&rdquo; &ldquo;Afrikaans is still supreme,&rdquo; he said.He called on young people to &ldquo;refuse the dominance of Afrikaans&rdquo; because it was an ordinary language like all 11 official languages.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why in the national anthem, we must stop singing the Afrikaans version, because we don&rsquo;t regard Afrikaans as a supreme language.&rdquo;He said changing names was a tool to liberate the country.&ldquo;South Africa will never be liberated unless we change the names. Most of you are saying what do we benefit, what is it going to benefit us when we change the names? We want jobs, is neither here nor there.&ldquo;We fight for employment at the same time we must liberate the mind. They don&rsquo;t want us to change the names of oppressors who killed us, saying it is part of history. We don&rsquo;t want to remember them.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
