This, along with the exceedingly high amounts of smuggling before our democracy came about, caused a massive influx of illegal weapons into the country, making them easily available now.&rdquo;According to a security boss, one of the major hot-spots for hiring AK47s in KZN is Msinga, north of Pietermaritzburg.&ldquo;Due to the faction fighting, weapons become easily available. The guns are transported from Msinga to Greytown and then into Pietermaritzburg,&rdquo; the security boss said.KZN violence monitor Mary de Haas said gun smuggling was prominent in the 1980s.&ldquo;A huge consignment from Vlakplaas went missing in 1994.&rdquo;Six truckloads of military grade weapons, &ldquo;enough to start a civil war&rdquo;, went missing.&ldquo;Only two trucks were accounted for and many of the weapons [including AK47s] are still in circulation,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;This country is awash with weapons.&rdquo;Earlier this month, the Pietermaritzburg Public Order Policing unit (POP) and Msinga police arrested three men with five firearms and 49 live rounds of ammunition.According to POP&rsquo;s Colonel Bhekisisa Hlongwane, 128 high-powered firearms have been recovered in and around the city since January.A source in the unit said that in the past three weeks, 37 firearms were recovered in the Greytown area, of which 25 were assault rifles.Gunfree South Africa&rsquo;s Claire Taylor said there are three sources of illegal weapons in the country:&bull; loss and theft from gun owners and police;&bull; fraud and corruption in the licensing system; and&bull; weapon smuggling across neighbouring borders.Of the three, Taylor said smuggling is the least of their concerns.&ldquo;Our research shows that now neighbouring countries view South Africa as the source of illegal firearms. We are smuggling guns out of the country more than we are bringing them in. This just shows how polluted the country is in terms of illegal firearms,&rdquo; Taylor said24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
