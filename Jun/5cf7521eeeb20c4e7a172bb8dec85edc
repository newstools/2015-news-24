Rather, the court would decide whether the footage could be admitted after hearing evidence from both state and defence witnesses.The State was expected to call its first witnesses in the trial-within-a-trial later on Monday morning.Mthethwa, born in Durban, is known for his large-format colour photographs, paintings and pastels of people in townships, informal settlements and rural areas.He has exhibited widely in the US, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa and Switzerland.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
