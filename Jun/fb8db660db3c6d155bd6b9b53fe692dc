To reduce the risk of this happening, Muthambi had signed agreements of co-operation with Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique. Namibia and Zimbabwe were finalising their agreements with South Africa.There would thus be no &ldquo;major negative impact on their analogue television services".Digital migration was still a &ldquo;top priority&rdquo; for the department, as it was important for clearing the spectrum for the delivery of broadband services."The digital migration project management office is hard at work to ensure that set-top boxes are manufactured and delivered to complete the migration process."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
