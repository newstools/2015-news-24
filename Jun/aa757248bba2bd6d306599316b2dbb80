And on Tuesday, when Nomonde Tete received the money for her artificial leg thanks to the Motsepe Foundation, her son Zolani received a double reward - seeing his mother's beaming face and being told his prize money is his to keep.Nomonde is diabetic and had to have her leg amputated in September 2012 due to her illness.Her plight was brought to the attention of the foundation and its founders&nbsp; when her son promised to buy her a new leg with the prize money he won from his IBF world super-flyweight title fight at Liverpool's Echo Arena against Paul Butler in the United Kingdom in March.&ldquo;After winning the fight I told myself that my dream just been realised and I am going to buy my mother a prosthetic leg, but the Motsepe Foundation beat me to it,&rdquo; said a beaming Tete.Watch a video of Zolani's fight below:The foundation was formed by mining mogul Patrice Motsepe and his wife Precious Moloi when they announced the Motsepe family would contribute at least half of the funds generated by their family assets towards improving the "lifestyles and living conditions of the poor, the disabled, unemployed, women, youth, workers and marginalised South Africans".Act of kindnessMoloi handed over a cheque for R110 000 to Tete&rsquo;s mother at the NU 12 Mdantsane community hall on Tuesday to cover the cost of the artificial limb.&ldquo;When we saw Zolani on the television saying that he is going to use all the money he won to buy his mother her leg, we were so touched. We thought that we should do something about this, as we felt Zolani shared the same values as us,&rdquo; said Motsepe.Nomonde could barely hold back her tears for the act of kindness.&ldquo;I feel so happy. There are no words in my vocabulary to express my gratitude. I wish all the best of luck to the Motsepe family and may God bless them and I will be eternally grateful to them,&rdquo; she said.A dream come trueHer son described the donation as, "a dream come true. I never thought, not even in my wildest dreams that this could happen. Mr Motsepe is my hero".At the handover ceremony, which was attended by Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle, MEC for Sport Pemmy Majodina, as well as a number of East London&rsquo;s greatest boxing champions, the Motsepe Foundation also handed over a cheque of R1m for the development of boxing in the city.The newly appointed Mayor of Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, Alfred Mtsi, expressed the city&rsquo;s gratitude.&ldquo;We are happy for what is done for us in Mdantsane, we cannot begin to thank the man that made this dream for many people in Mdantsane a reality and we promise to also do more in ensuring this dream becomes a success,&rdquo; he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
