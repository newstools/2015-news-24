Hanover - Upset that a group of children were not being careful enough while playing near her one-year-old, a German mother went on a playground rampage with pepper spray, leaving four injured, police reported on Monday. "This is certainly an unusual case," said a police spokesperson. The woman, aged 20, was allegedly upset that a group of children were not being careful enough while playing with a ball near her toddler on Sunday. Police in the northern German town of Peine said three children, aged 11 to 15, as well as a woman in a wheelchair, reported slight injuries related to the pepper spray. She was arrested when witnesses alerted authorities as the woman left the playground following the incident. Police have opened an investigation on assault charges.
