Inge StrydomHARRISMITH. The Phuthaditjhaba Family, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit, through Det. Const. Selloane Mokoteli, saw to it that two of the four men from Mandela Park near Phuthaditjhaba who had been accused of rape and house robbery pleaded guilty and were sentenced. The case was postponed because two of the accused had withdrawn their lawyers and had sought new representation. They appeared before the Harrismith High Court on Monday, 1 June, and two of the five accused pleaded guilty. Rorisang Motebang (22) was sentenced to an effective 25 years imprisonment for rape and Thabang Innocent Morake (21) to five years for conspiracy, suspended for four years. The three co-accused, Boka Lefasa, Tankiso Khanye and Keresemese Mokoena, all in their 20s, will return to the same court to face trial from 19 to 23 October on charges of rape and robbery. Four young men entered the house of the victim (29) who was in the house with their domestic worker and her baby on 7 May 2013 at about 09:30. The suspects pretended that they wanted to buy some items, because the owner was a business man. The men became aggressive and one threatened her with a knife. Another ransacked the house looking for money and the others tied up the 55-year-old domestic worker in the kitchen. Three of the men took turns in raping the 29-year-old. They fled with an undisclosed amount of cash. They were arrested and remained in prison awaiting trial24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
