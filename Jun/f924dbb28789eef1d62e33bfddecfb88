Nasr Akr, an al-Qaeda-inspired militant once jailed in the UK on terrorism charges, was assassinated along with his aide in the eastern town of Darna, home to many of Libya's veteran jihadists. Akr's group, known as the Shura Council of Darna's Jihadists, announced his killing in a statement on Wednesday, blaming it on Islamic State militants and vowing retaliation. Akr's killing sparked heavy fighting, leaving at least nine ISIS militants dead, witnesses said. ISIS seized control of Darna last year. ISIS began as an al-Qaeda affiliate but later had a bitter falling out with the global jihadist network. The two groups have also clashed in Syria. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
