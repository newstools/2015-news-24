Pietermaritzburg - KwaZulu-Natal's rising multi-billion rand debt to the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) is expected to be discussed at a high-level meeting on Thursday. The NHLS will meet with National Treasury and the KZN Health Department to discuss the billing system and the alleged four-year backlog in payments by the KZN Health Department. In March 2014 the service claimed the KZN Health department owed them R3 billion and suspended the collection of samples from across the province. The laboratory plays a pivotal role in the province’s fight against HIV/Aids and TB. The lab also deals with a large volume of cancer-related tests which are essential in diagnosing the illness and informing treatment options. The NHLS confirmed that “there are outstanding accounts from provinces that are being dealt with” but said the details could not be discussed with the media. “The NHLS is not at liberty to disclose any further information regarding its discussions with DOH-KZN or any other province, until negotiations with the ­provinces have been finalised and closed.” KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said on Wednesday the issue would be discussed on Thursday and would only answer questions after the conclusion of the meeting between NHLS, National Treasury and the KZN Health department. “We have to respect the conclusion of the meeting for all to report to their principals before the outcomes are made public,” he said
