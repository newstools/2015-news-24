"Clearly, for France, security issues have taken the upper hand," said Pierre Vermeren, a specialist on the Maghreb region. "Algeria is also one of the main actors in stabilising the situation in Libya along with the UN, and obviously France is counting on its capacity for mediation," he said.Ties 'unrivalled'The defrosting of ties between Paris and Algiers in recent years comes half-a-century after French forces brutally cracked down on Algerians fighting for independence in a 1954-62 war that left some 1.5 million Algerians dead.The topic has remained a deep wound between the countries who - despite their troubled past - remain closely linked with more than half a million Algerians living in France.However, French ambassador to Algiers Bernard Emie recently said that Bouteflika described the current relations with Paris as "unrivalled".Algeria is still dealing with the fallout from a civil war between the military and Islamist militants in the 1990s that left tens of thousands dead.During that time it was the birthplace of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat which later became an al-Qaeda affiliate - carrying out attacks and kidnappings both in Algeria and across the border in Mali and Mauritania.The group, known as al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) played a key role in the takeover of northern Mali in 2012.Politically, Paris steers clear of commenting on 78-year-old Bouteflika's ill-health and the accusations his recent re-election for a fourth term was riddled with fraud.France - whose economy is sorely in need of a boost - is also keen to win back the title of Algeria's main trade partner, which China won in 2013. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
