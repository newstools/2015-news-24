Her body was discovered on Sunday, the same day that marked the start of Child Protection Week. Provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut, told News24 the teenager’s body was discovered under the suspect’s bed on Sunday morning. “[The girl] was staying with him at his residence...” he said. “The circumstances surrounding the matter are still under investigation.” According to the Bredasdorp Community Police Forum, the child had allegedly been in a relationship with the suspect for the past two years. Social Development MEC Albert Fritz said his department was sending a team of social workers to the family of the murdered child. “As we commemorate Child Protection Week, we continue to urge parents to play the greatest role in ensuring we protect and provide an enabling space for our children,” he said. “If you see something, say something!” The incident comes two years after the murder of local teenager Anene Booysen, who was found raped and disembowelled in the town in February 2013. She later died at the Tygerberg Hospital where staff battled to save her life. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
