I only hope it goes well," said the round-faced widow in a colourful kaftan with a matching head wrap.'I will return'As part of the investigation, Sankara's remains were exhumed in late May, together with those of his fallen comrades.Apart from identifying the bodies, the operation aims to determine their cause of death, "because we were given certificates saying they died of natural causes", Sankara said.She hopes that former colonial power France can also help answer questions."France has been cited as a possible accomplice in the assassination. If we open the archives we would know who is responsible," she said, her voice calm but determined."It is in the interest of France, Burkina Faso and all Africa that the truth be known".Sankara said she has written to three French presidents about the matter: Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and current leader Francois Hollande.Chirac and Sarkozy both replied with pledges to avoid any further French meddling in Burkina Faso's affairs. Hollande has yet to respond, she said.She hopes that French deputies will accept her request for a parliamentary inquiry, but acknowledges it will be "difficult" - two previous such requests from Burkina Faso lawmakers having gone unanswered.Sankara received a hero's welcome on her return to Burkina Faso in May for the exhumation of her husband's grave, but the retiring ex-first lady insisted she had no political ambitions herself."I don't see myself in a political role," she said, noting that Sankara supporters already had a candidate for president in October elections in Benewende Sankara, who is no relation.But she has registered to vote and might campaign for the other Sankara. She is also mulling thoughts of a permanent return."I will go back to Burkina some day. My mother is there, my brothers are there. I will return," she said.Her two sons, Philippe and Auguste, who are now in their thirties and living in the United States, might join her there, she says."They are Burkinabe, we all remain Burkinabe." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
