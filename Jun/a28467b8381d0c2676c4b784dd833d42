The disease was detected last year while he was being treated after being stabbed in prison.Delivering his judgement, Baqwa said he had found flaws in Masutha's review of Derby-Lewis's medical parole application.This included Masutha's views that Derby-Lewis had not expressed remorse for his part in the murder of SA Communist Party leader, Chris Hani.During the hearing, in an effort to show that Derby-Lewis had shown remorse, his lawyer said there had been an invitation to Hani's widow, Limpho, to visit him in hospital for a face-to-face apology. She had not taken up the offer.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
