He said they submitted their samples over the last two weeks.According to World Health Organisation guidelines, a cholera outbreak should be declared when there are 10-20 cases.The ministry had been expected to declare an outbreak on Monday, but the event was cancelled abruptly and no reason was given."The information is still not out there," Maker said in the Monday meeting for the country's cholera task force. "Many people don't know what we are dealing with."Last year a cholera outbreak in South Sudan infected more than 6 000 people and killed 167, according to WHO figures.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
