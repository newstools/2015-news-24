has been threatened by "racists" who wanted him to back off from
Curro Roodeplaat Primary School. "I must confirm that I have received threats from
people who believe that racism is the future," Lesufi told reporters on
Friday. "I have had to close some of my social accounts because
I was bombarded with threats by people of a particular race," he said. Lesufi said he would not bow to the pressure. "Anyone who believes they can intimidate me...
Unfortunately, I am not easily intimidated," he said. Curro’s last chance Lesufi was addressing the media at the education department
offices in Johannesburg, where he announced he had suspended his decision to
shut down Curro. The private school has been marred by incidents of racism
and segregation. Lesufi said Curro had admitted that the incidents that
unfolded at the school were racist. "The good thing is that the board did not justify it.
They accepted that it was something completely unacceptable." Lesufi said he would give the school one more chance to
change its ways. This followed a video depicting school pupils being led off
buses, apparently according to race, while on a field trip. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
