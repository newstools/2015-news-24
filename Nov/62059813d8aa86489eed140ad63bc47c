After an international outcry, the Kenyan government declared the playground the property of the school.Illegal land grabs are a serious problem in Kenya and are believed to be fuelled by the bribe-taking culture endemic in East Africa's largest economy.A 2008 government commission looking into violence after a flawed presidential election in 2007 found historical injustices such as unequal land distribution as partly to blame for the violence. More than 1 000 people died and 600 000 were evicted from their homes during the clashes.Also, a 2013 Truth Justice and Reconciliation report on historical injustices in Kenya after it gained its independence in 1963 found grievances over land were the single most important driver of conflicts and ethnic tension in Kenya.President Uhuru Kenyatta's family members - especially his father, founding President Jomo Kenyatta - were named in the report as presiding over a government responsible for numerous human rights violations and illegal allocations of land.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
