Far too many motorists continue to be distracted by their mobile phones, which is an offence in itself..."Several of the arrests were made after tip-offs from the public, he said.In one of the incidents, the CCTV Control Room witnessed a smash-and-grab and alerted the officers stationed in the vicinity. The suspect could be seen running away from the vehicle with the motorist&rsquo;s belongings while brandishing a knife.Officers apprehended him after waiting as he crossed Jakes Gerwel Drive into Langa.
