Ingrid Oellermann, The WitnessA still from the movie Blood Lions, a documentary which follows South African conservationist Ian Michler and Rick Swazey, an American hunter, on their journey to the lion-hunting industries.

And we don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s not what we want.&rdquo;Gous also allegedly said the cubs were taken from their mothers 10 days after birth. In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers for two years but when forcibly removed the lionesses go back into oestrus to facilitate &ldquo;multiple breeding cycles&rdquo;, said Hankinson.She alleged the inescapable conclusion was that Zanchieta took the cubs away &ldquo;for this sole purpose&rdquo;.Hankinson said images of volunteers hand-rearing and playing with cubs at the nursery on the farm appear on YouTube.She further alleges that in &ldquo;raw footage&rdquo; not included in the documentary, Gous allegedly acknowledged that Zanchieta raised lion cubs for breeders, which were sent back to the breeders to be sold to reserves; confirmed that one of Zanchieta&rsquo;s lionesses, Princess, had three white cubs of which two were sold to a private reserve in Denmark, and spoke about servals (Sylvester and Malan) being sold or given to Letsatsi La Africa game lodge, which has been linked to the bone trade and &ldquo;wildlife trafficking&rdquo;.These allegations made by Hankinson are vehemently denied in replying papers by Gous and the owner of Zanchieta, Lizette van Schalkwyk.Van Schalkwyk says she asked Gous if she remembered any conversation with Ian Michler (lead character in the documentary) and she denied having made the statements alleged, or maintained she was quoted out of context.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
