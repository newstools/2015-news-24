Holtzman was placed on precautionary suspension in July for alleged security breaches. She approached the CCMA, claiming her suspension was unfair. Parliament's secretary Gengezi Mgidlana said&nbsp;on Monday that the CCMA had&nbsp;ruled in their favour, indicating that the processes had been correct and sound. "Basically, the CCMA has indicated that the application that was made by [Holtzman] did not hold water. That puts us on course in terms of making sure we follow all due process and... make sure it&rsquo;s a fair process that allows all parties to engage." Parliament&rsquo;s Advocate Zuraya Adhikarie said they had argued that the CCMA did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter. "The commissioner released its ruling today that, in fact, the CCMA did not have jurisdiction. So that basically leaves Parliament free to proceed with the disciplinary hearing against Holtzman." Holtzman also approached the Labour Court to interdict Parliament from holding the disciplinary hearing. Judgment in that case was reserved on Friday.She could not be reached for comment on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
