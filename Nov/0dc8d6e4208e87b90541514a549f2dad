The police officers have pleaded not guilty and will be back in court&nbsp;on Tuesday.Pangolin poaching is on the rise in Zimbabwe although authorities have been clamping down hard on offenders.Zimbabwe's&nbsp;Tikki Hywood Trust&nbsp;often cares for anteaters rescued from poachers.The trust reported&nbsp;on Sunday&nbsp;that an elderly much-abused male pangolin that had been brought to the centre had died."He was a fine gentleman, gentle and brave and he fought a tremendous fight," the group said in an update to Facebook."Sadly due to anorexia and dehydration together with his age he did not win this fight and passed away," it added.It did not say where the pangolin had been captured.Pangolins are valued for their meat and their large overlapping scales, which are used in traditional and Asian medicines.
