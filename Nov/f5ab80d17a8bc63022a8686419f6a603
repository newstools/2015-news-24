The 2.5m long reptile had been trussed up in a large plastic bag, the Manica Post reported. The snake was only found when a passenger (apparently not the snake's owner) asked to look through unclaimed luggage that had been moved from the bus into a room at the bus company's headquarters in Mutare in eastern Zimbabwe, the paper said. Said Inter-Africa bus company branch manager Kudakwashe Nedziwe: "We were looking for a passenger's luggage before we discovered some movement in a yellow sack. "Further investigations revealed that it was a snake, a big python." The newspaper said that suspicions were high that the snake was abandoned by a man fleeing "witch hunters" in the Nyika area, which was on the Masvingo to Mutare route that the bus plies. Sometimes locals keep snakes because they believe it will help their businesses prosper. The snake was stoned to death, the newspaper reported. There were no reports of arrests so far, though pythons are protected animals in Zimbabwe and it is an offence to keep or kill them. Last week, NewZimbabwe reported that a man from Chipinge was imprisoned for nine years after he was found in possession of two python skins. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
