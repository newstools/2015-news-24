"We cannot allow them to impose another form of religion" with practices that "do not correspond to our traditions or our conceptions of Islam", he said, citing any obligation to wear the full Islamic veil as an example of extremism."We must have the courage to fight this excessive form" of Islam, Sall added.Senegal is a secular state in west Africa where more than 92% of an estimated population of 14 million are Muslims.The president's remarks echoed those made by French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who also called for the promotion of moderate interpretations of Islam and for radical Islamist propaganda over social media to be fought.Sall also pushed for better intelligence sharing between the countries of the Sahel on the southern edge of the Sahara in an effort to combat armed jihadist groups that operate across borders.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
