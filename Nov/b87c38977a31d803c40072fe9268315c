The official says the bombing on Tuesday morning took place in Msallata, a town southeast of Tripoli. He says the explosion also wounded 17 people, 10 of them critically. Most were civilians waiting to pass through the checkpoint. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak with reporters. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Libya's Islamic State affiliate has staged similar attacks. Libya has been in turmoil following the toppling and killing of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi. It has split into an internationally recognised government, based in the far east, and an Islamist militia-backed government in Tripoli. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
