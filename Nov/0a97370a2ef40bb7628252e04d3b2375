During Ebola, their parents did not have money so many girls had to go to men," one girl told Amnesty.Encouraging pregnancies?Even before Ebola broke out in December 2013, Sierra Leone had one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the world. One in four girls between the ages of 15 and 19 had children or were pregnant, a government health survey from 2013 found.Preliminary estimates from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) put the number of teenage girls who became pregnant in Sierra Leone at the height of the Ebola outbreak at more than 14,300.After the ban was imposed earlier this year, The Ministry of Education said allowing pregnant girls to go to school would undermine their ability to concentrate and participate in class, expose them to ridicule and encourage others to become pregnant.The government announced in May an alternative "bridging" education system allowing pregnant girls to go school, but at different premises and times to their peers, which could lead to further stigmatisation and marginalisation, Amnesty said.Only six in 10 girls between the ages of 15 and 24 in Sierra Leone are literate, compared with three-quarters of boys in that age range, figures from the 2013 government health survey show.Education after birth"Education is a right and not something for governments to arbitrarily take away as a punishment," Mahtani said."Pregnant girls are being denied key chances to move forward with their lives, and to ensure early pregnancy does not become the event that determines the rest of their lives."Several organisations including Unicef, the UK Department for International Development and UNFPA are helping girls to continue their education after giving birth, and give counselling and access to maternal and neonatal health services.Maternal death rates in Sierra Leone halved between 1990 and 2013, yet it still has one of the highest rates in the world - more than one in 100 women dies in childbirth - according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
