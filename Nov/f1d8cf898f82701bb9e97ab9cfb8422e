driver Mido Macia were each sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in the High
Court in Pretoria on Wednesday. Judge Bert Bam found that life imprisonment would not be
appropriate because the eight policemen had excellent service records. He found them guilty in August of Macia's murder in February
2013, when the taxi driver died in a police cell hours after being handcuffed
to a police van and dragged through the streets of Daveyton. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
