Johannesburg - The City of Johannesburg implemented level two water restrictions on Monday. "Rand Water notified us of a further deterioration in the bulk supply system this morning [Monday], recommending a higher level of water supply restrictions," Environment and Infrastructure Services mayoral committee member Matshidiso Mfikoe said in a statement. Level two restrictions meant: - No watering and irrigating gardens between 06:00 and 18:00. - No filling of swimming pools. - No using of hose pipes to wash cars, paved areas, etc. Mfikoe said, although water was still available, the system supply pressure would be reduced. "In the event that the situation deteriorates further, a level three restriction would have to be imposed. "Level three would entail supply of water at stipulated times a day, namely, only in the mornings and in the evenings at times to be announced," she said. This would mean that water would not be supplied outside the stipulated times. Residents were urged to comply with the level two restrictions.
