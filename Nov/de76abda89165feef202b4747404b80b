Crime statistics have shown that in most of these cases women and children are the victims. The event was graced by the presence of the provincial commissioner of the Northern Cape, Lt. Gen. Risimati Peter Shivuri, and several other stakeholders. The members who were awarded for their excellent and outstanding work included four visible policing relief workers, two of the crime prevention unit, two female constables of the Kimberley Flying Squad and 12 investigating officers of the Kimberley Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. Some of the domestic violence survivors were also acknowledged at the event for their courage and for standing up against abuse.The purpose of the award ceremony was to motivate and acknowledge the members who were investigating such cases. The awards came as some solace for the trauma and stress that accompanied these types of investigations. The safety of women and children still remains a priority for the South African Police Service. We can therefore applaud these police members and the public for making sure that the perpetrators are arrested and brought to book, said police spokesperson Lt. Sergio Kock in a statement.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
