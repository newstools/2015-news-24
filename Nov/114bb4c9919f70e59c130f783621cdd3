Traffic chief Kenny Africa said two lanes heading towards Somerset Mall were closed. One lane in the direction of Stellenbosch was closed. The crash took place on the bridge that crosses the N2, he said. “The motorcyclist, understood to be a foreigner, died in the accident. The occupants in the four vehicles sustained no serious injuries,” Africa said. The cause of the crash is being investigated. By 09:00 the site had been cleared and all roads were reopened, he said. Cable theft resulted in train delays of up to an hour on Wednesday morning and commuters travelling from Hout Bay and the Atlantic Seaboard were stranded because of a planned taxi protest.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
