arrested in connection with the murder of a school matron, is expected back in
court on Monday. The pupil from Jimmy Roos Youth Centre in Dewetsdorp appeared
briefly in the Dewetsdorp Magistrate's Court on Thursday on charges of murder,
but his case was postponed. On Tuesday, Karin Barnard, 50, who was the matron at the
school hostel, was found dead next to her bakkie in the youth centre's yard. "Her lifeless body was found by two schoolboys who then
alerted the... principal who informed the police," said Sergeant Yanda
Ngcukana. Ngcukana said Barnard was found lying on the ground. Her
face, as well as two rocks lying next to her, were covered in blood. "We found blood stains on the 15-year-old boy's T-shirt
and arrested him for the crime." He said the motive for the murder was still unknown. The pupil remains in custody. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
