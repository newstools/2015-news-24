The 24-year-old suspect would appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, police spokesperson captain FC Van Wyk said. University spokesperson Gerda Kruger said support services had been made available to those involved in the incident, alleged to have taken place on Sunday, and a UCT senior investigator was also investigating “all the aspects of the case”. The woman apparently posted details of the incident on Facebook on Sunday, while a photograph of the alleged perpetrator was circulated on social media along with his name. Kruger said the university was aware of the allegations being levelled against “a particular individual who allegedly was involved in the sexual assault of a female student”. “The accused in the case must be treated according to fair and appropriate legal process. It is for the justice system, not social media, to find the person guilty or innocent, after due process,” she said. “We ask people to consider the fact rape and sexual assault is a dreadful reality for citizens of our country. It is therefore important to treat the matter with utmost seriousness and within due process and due legality. UCT certainly intends to do so.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
