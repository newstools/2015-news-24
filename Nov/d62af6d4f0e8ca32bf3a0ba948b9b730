Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha said the man worked for a company that was repairing the awnings on the building in Warner Beach on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. He was trying to secure an awning in heavy wind when he fell on Tuesday. Paramedics arrived on the scene to find that the man had already died.
