Andries Zulu (28) has pleaded not guilty before Judge Nkosinathi Chili to taking part in Uys&rsquo;s murder on May 31, 2012 for a fee, and to robbing Uys of a Toyota Landcruiser, a .38 revolver with 25 live rounds of ammunition, two cellphones, a laptop and R18 510 in cash. He denies knowing anything about the incident.The state alleges that Zulu was in cahoots with another hitman, Hercules Mbata, who is currently serving a 25-year jail term after pleading guilty and turning state witness against Zulu.The man who allegedly hired the two hitmen &mdash; Uys&rsquo;s former business partner, Christiaan Daniel Smith (46) from Secunda in Mpumalanga &mdash; is still on the run after jumping bail.
