It is necessary that as journalists we hold public figures to account for what they say," Ezeamalu said at the ceremony.Sensitive topicPeter Cunliffe-Jones, founder of Africa Check, hailed the winning report for "taking a claim on a sensitive topic - the age of consent in Nigeria - and clinically, carefully examining the evidence to show it was false."The two runner-up prizes went to South African journalists Phillip de Wet, of the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper, and Pieter-Louis Myburgh, from the Media24 news group.De Wet was commended for his report about spending on the home of President Jacob Zuma and comparisons with the late former president Nelson Mandela, while Myburgh exposed false claims about train safety.The awards ceremony on Thursday evening, hosted by the African Media Initiative, also marked the launch of a French-language version of Africa Check: www.fr.africacheck.org.'We hope to achieve similar success'The new website, known as Africa Check_FR, is edited in Dakar by Senegalese journalist Assane Diagne, formerly editor-in-chief of the APS news agency."Every day, traditional media and the social networks are inundated with claims by the leaders of public opinion that are less than accurate," Diagne said."It is this huge field, ignored to date by the African media, that Africa Check is seeking to explore."Emmanuel Hoog, AFP CEO and chairperson of the AFP Foundation, praised Africa Check for "bringing independent, non-partisan fact-checking to public debate and the media in anglophone Africa.""We hope to achieve similar success in the continent's French-speaking countries," he added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
