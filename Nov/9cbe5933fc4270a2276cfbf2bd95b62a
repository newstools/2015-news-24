She was replaced by Polly Boshielo.Netsianda said Ramadwa is still a member of the provincial legislature, although she is no longer the speaker.City Press reported that sources close to Ramadwa said she was removed from her position because she would not allow political interference in the legislature and that she made decisions based on organisational policy. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
