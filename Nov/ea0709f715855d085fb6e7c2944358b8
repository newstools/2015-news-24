We are a God-fearing nation and have a right to practice our religious convictions,&rdquo; Ehrenreich said in a statement.Following Rose&rsquo;s initial suspension, Cosatu said this was &ldquo;clearly a precursor to dismissal for an offence that clearly is not life threatening&rdquo;.&ldquo;Suspensions can only be applied in certain circumstances where a serious prejudice exists for a company. The complaint from one rich customer from Milnerton should be ignored as this city and its facilities should not be used to pander to these spoilt brats.&rdquo;Rose, who has been driving the Cape Town/Atlantis route for the past year, told News24 he was given a verbal warning last Friday to stop leading passengers in prayer after a passenger submitted a written complaint.But on Monday he prayed again, arguing he is &ldquo;a Christian first, then a bus driver&rdquo;.&lsquo;City practices praying during meetings&rsquo;A colleague apparently caught the prayer session on video, and on Tuesday he was given a final written warning. But on Wednesday, Rose again started the day with a prayer.He was suspended and attended a disciplinary hearing on Thursday.Rose was informed of his dismissal on Friday, but plans to appeal the ruling.Ehrenreich said the action is &ldquo;contrary to the city&rsquo;s own practices of praying in council meetings irrespective of the views of others&rdquo;.&ldquo;The city should apply its standards consistently or not at all, because then the mayor should also be suspended for allowing prayers in council meetings,&rdquo; he said.But Mayor Patricia de Lille&rsquo;s spokesperson Zara Nicholson said as far as she was aware, there were no prayers during council meetings.Furthermore, she argued that the proceedings in council - which is a government structure led by the Speaker - could not be compared to a company&rsquo;s rules and regulations.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
