No one was killed. MENA news agency said the three attackers escaped after the firefight on Thursday. It said police guarding the evangelical church near the Giza pyramids were left with scrapes and bruises. Attacks on churches and Egypt's Christian minority have increased over the past decade as tensions, sometimes exacerbated by officials, grew with the Muslim majority. Egypt's Coptic Christians have long complained of being treated like second-class citizens. Once a majority, they are now about 10% of the country's 85 million people, making them the largest Christian community in the Middle East. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
