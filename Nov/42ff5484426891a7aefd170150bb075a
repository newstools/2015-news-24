	     Durban – A top Durban city official has called on the public protector’s office to furnish more information about a Section 36 investigation being conducted at the eThekwini metro.  The municipality previously came under fire for the use of Section 36, which allows officials to bypass supply chain processes and grant tenders. Section 36 was created for use in emergencies or disaster relief situations.   In a statement on Thursday, eThekwini municipal manager said the city was willing to assist the public protector in the investigation. It had already hosted a meeting with officials from Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s office and city manager Sbusiso Sithole. At the meeting, Sithole said he requested that the representatives from the public protectors office "be more specific about the Section 36 contracts under investigation" so that the information could be made available to them. "There has been no further communication from the public protector’s office on this issue. We indicated during the meeting that this matter cannot be a fishing expedition. We are willing to give them reports with the information they require," said Sithole. Sithole said monthly reports were compiled by the city on all tenders awarded, including Section 36 contracts. "The Section 36 reports are easily accessible to all councillors, therefore the city has no reason not to provide the reports to the public protector," said Sithole. In the 2013/14 financial year, the use of Section 36 of the supply chain management policy was reduced from R1 897 435 909.14 in the 2012/2013 financial year to R1 634 258 389.61 in the 2013/2014 financial year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
