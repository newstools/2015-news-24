Johannesburg - A police officer from Moroka, Soweto, who went missing and was feared to have been kidnapped, has been found safe and well. Captain Mpande Khoza said the officer had gone to visit a female friend for the weekend, but did not tell his family. Last week, News24 reported that Hamlet Ngudumane was last seen on Friday at about 18:00 after a colleague's farewell party in Protea Glen. He left, saying he was going to drop colleagues in Lehae, but he never returned. His colleagues believed he had been hijacked and kidnapped. Khoza on Tuesday said after News24 published the story, people started calling to inform police of Ngudumane's whereabouts. "[They] started calling police, saying they have seen him around Rockville in Soweto. That's when we found he was not in danger," said Khoza. "The question was why he didn't inform his family [that] he was not going to come back because his wife was crying."
