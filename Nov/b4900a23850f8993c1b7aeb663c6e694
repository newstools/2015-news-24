The court did not specify where it would move the trial.Mubarak, 87, was originally sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for conspiring to murder 239 demonstrators, sowing chaos and creating a security vacuum during an 18-day revolt which began in January 2011, but a retrial was ordered on appeal.In that retrial, an Egyptian court in November dropped its case against him but public prosecutors appealed.Mubarak-era figures are slowly being cleared of charges and a series of laws limiting political freedoms have raised fears that the old leadership is regaining influence.Many Egyptians who lived through Mubarak's rule view it as a period of autocracy and crony capitalism. His overthrow led to Egypt's first free election, which brought in Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.But Morsi only lasted a year in office after mass protests against his rule in 2013 prompted then military chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to take power. Sisi went on to win a presidential election last year.He has since cracked down on Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood and thousands of Brotherhood supporters have been jailed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
