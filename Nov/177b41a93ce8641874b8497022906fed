	     Cape Town - Parliament's head of protection services wants the Labour Court to grant an urgent interdict stopping her disciplinary hearing, Eyewitness News reported on Friday. In court papers, Zelda Holtzman argued that she was suspended after raising concerns with Parliament's secretary Gengezi Mgidlana about his use of official vehicles with blue lights, the broadcaster reported. Holtzman and her deputy, Motlatsi Mokgatle, were placed on precautionary suspension earlier this year pending an investigation into alleged security breaches. According to EWN, Holtzman's advocate Johann Nortje told the court that his client had received complaints from her staff that Mgidlana had instructed them to drive him and his family around in official vehicles with blue lights. Holtzman also expressed concern about the recruitment of police officers to beef up the parliamentary protection unit. She turned to the CCMA, claiming she had been treated unfairly, according to EWN. Her lawyers argued that her disciplinary hearing could not go ahead because the CCMA was dealing with her dispute. The CCMA is expected to make a decision on Monday on whether it had jurisdiction to deal with Holtzman's case. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
