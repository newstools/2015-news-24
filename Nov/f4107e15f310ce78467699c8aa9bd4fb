A memo was sent out by the court manager&rsquo;s office informing staff that the problem was due to the fact that water was being supplied via &ldquo;Jojo tanks&rdquo;, which were found to be infested with droppings. According to the memo, the Public Works Department was supposed to purify the water regularly, but this was not being done.The KZN Director of Public Prosecutions, Sophy Moipone Noko, confirmed via her spokesperson Natasha Kara that her office had been alerted to the contaminated water problem.&ldquo;To ensure staff safety, we bought plenty of bottled water for drinking. This can also be used to make tea, coffee etc. should they wish to do so,&rdquo; she said.Noko added that since there were flushing toilets, there were &ldquo;no hygiene concerns&rdquo; and work at the offices was proceeding as normal.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
