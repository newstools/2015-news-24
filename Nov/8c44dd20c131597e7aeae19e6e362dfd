Washington - The US lifted sanctions on Thursday on Liberia that it had imposed more than a decade ago to target the regime of former Liberian president Charles Taylor. US President Barack Obama signed an executive order lifting the sanctions, pointing to progress made in the West African nation and Taylor's sentencing to 50 years in prison in 2012. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price pointed to "Liberia's tremendous progress since emerging from civil war in 2003, in particular its commitment to democracy and the development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions". Liberia has "overcome not only the scars of war but also the challenge of responding to an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola" last year, Price said. But he said work remained as Liberia looks to the end of a UN mission next year and presidential elections in 2017. The sanctions had targeted members of Taylor's family and his regime and those involved in unlawfully depleting the country's resources. The sanctions had also originally banned imports of Liberia logs and timber products and diamonds that were lifted earlier. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
