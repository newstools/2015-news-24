Presiding Judge Robert Henney granted him indemnity from prosecution on two charges - conspiracy to commit murder and illegal possession of ammunition.Ntabazalila said he did, therefore, not "run the risk" of being prosecuted when he testified in Dewani&rsquo;s trial last year. Despite this, Traverso decided not to grant him immunity. De Kock decided that Henney&rsquo;s ruling remained valid and informed Mbolombo accordingly.Tongo is serving an 18-year jail term and Qwabe, a 25-year jail term. Mngeni was serving life in jail for firing the shot that killed Hindocha, but died in prison from a brain tumour on October 18 last year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
