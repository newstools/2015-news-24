I&rsquo;m saying I can do without someone to speak on my behalf, a lieutenant general solely responsible to speak on my behalf."He said he was attempting to ensure accountability and to consolidate authority at all levels.Phahlane told Parliament the new structure, which increases deputy national commissioners and component heads, would not be top heavy. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
