At these distribution points, question papers were stored for a minimum of five days, and there was a lack of adequate security at many of these distribution points.&rdquo;Motshekga said at a media briefing in Polokwane, the paper was probably leaked due to poor security, a shortage of staff and "untimely" renovations at the province's exam centre.The department said the paper was sent to the province on Friday due to logistical reasons. They took the decision to allow the examination to continue. Motshekga said there were security concerns beforehand, like the storage and packing area at their new premises which were not secure.&ldquo;The provincial education department lacked the capacity to monitor the examinations adequately, given the long distances, the limited vehicles available in districts and the poor roadworthiness of many fleet cars,&rdquo; said Motshekga.She said investigations will resolve the matter and make a determination on what action should be taken.It is not yet clear if the department will manage to complete marking without hurdles.Said Motshekga: &ldquo;The provincial education department&rsquo;s marker appointment system and processes are not strictly compliant with the criteria listed in the Personal Administrative Measures [PAM].&rdquo;Umalusi, SAQA, Unisa and the police have been roped in to help with the investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
