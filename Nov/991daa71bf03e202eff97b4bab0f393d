Rodgers said &ldquo;this precarious situation could have dire consequences on essential service delivery&rdquo; as departments scramble to cut costs to reduce their &ldquo;massive predicted over-expenditure&rdquo;. &ldquo;Any cuts on departmental base line budgets will have a detrimental effect on service delivery.&ldquo;The leading culprit behind this fiscal time bomb is KZN&rsquo;s Health Department, which is predicted to overspend by R802 million,&rdquo; said Rodgers.He said this is followed by the departments of Social Development, Co-operative Governance and Public Works.He said not only does this represent complete &ldquo;apathy and massive inefficiency&rdquo;, but that it &ldquo;also highlights the massive disparity&rdquo; that exists between Treasury and certain departments.&ldquo;KZN now stands on the edge of a fiscal cliff and it is going to demand exceptional and strong leadership to bring the province back from the brink of disaster,&rdquo; said Rodgers. Maphisa, while admitting that the Health Department was &ldquo;in the same situation last year&rdquo;, said they will &ldquo;impose a cost containment plan&rdquo; approved and closely monitored by Treasury. &ldquo;There is absolutely no disparity between Treasury and departments. Spending is monitored &hellip; monthly. We do not sit idly by when departments overspend.&rdquo;He said his department &ldquo;has dedicated budget analysts for each department&rdquo;. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
