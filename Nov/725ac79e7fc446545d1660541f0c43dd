	     Cape Town – A man was arrested at a shopping mall in Milnerton, allegedly with a kilogram of tik (methamphetamine) in his possession, Western Cape police said on Friday. Officers swooped on the 39-year-old and a male acquaintance leaving the mall on Thursday, said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut. The police were following up on information and spotted the pair acting suspiciously. When they became aware of police presence, one of the men fled in his vehicle. The other man dropped his bag and made “a brief attempt” to flee on foot but was apprehended, said Traut. He will appear in court on a charge of drug dealing. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
