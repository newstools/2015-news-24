We had to rescue the children immediately,&rdquo; the source said.When police entered the premises last week, they found four children &ldquo;naked and playing in the cold&rdquo; while the women &ldquo;were inside sitting around a fire&rdquo;.Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Mthokozisi Ngobese said although there were no acts of prostitution taking place when police arrived, one of the women admitted they charge an hourly rate of R50. &ldquo;The owner has been notified and was given 14 days to remove the illegal occupants from his property. He has since ensured us that he will comply,&rdquo; Ngobese said.The children were removed by social workers and members of the Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit.Driemeyer said Naidoo reported the illegal squatters to police on three occasions and enlisted a security guard who was &ldquo;beaten up and stabbed&rdquo;. &ldquo;Our client is now resorting to the drastic measure of removing the roof, as well as welding shut access points to the property,&rdquo; &shy;Driemeyer said.Before referring The Witness to his lawyers yesterday, Naidoo said the property was in the process of being sold. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
