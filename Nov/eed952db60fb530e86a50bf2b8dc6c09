This automatically puts every gay person in danger to be attacked for &lsquo;causing drought&rsquo; in the province.&rdquo;Mncwango called on the Shembe church members to &ldquo;come out strongly against their leader&rsquo;s utterances and distance themselves from such remarks&rdquo;. He added that Section 9 (3) of South Africa's Constitution prohibited unfair discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.&ldquo;The remark smacks all the efforts that have been made to end the discrimination of people according to their sexual orientation."Durban Lesbian and Gay Community and Health Centre director Nonhlanhla Mkhize said the negative statements from the religious leader took society backward. &ldquo;It seems like these comments were an attempt to galvanise support. We are shocked and appalled by this type of thinking. It is frustrating, because there are many who battle to be accepted if they are gay or lesbian. These comments do not allow one to be themselves amongst their religious denomination.&rdquo;&nbsp;The Shembe Church leader could not be reached for comment.&nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
