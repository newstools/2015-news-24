Additional street lamps have been installed in The Paddocks, which is the grassed area above the art gallery and opposite the museum.&nbsp; &ldquo;This area was previously under-lit, but with the installation of extra lighting it has become much safer at night." &nbsp; City parks have employed private security guards to patrol the Company Gardens on a daily basis, both during the day and at night.&nbsp;&lsquo;Safe place&rsquo;Walker said she believed working in collaboration with all role players will make progress possible. "The City has enhanced security in the gardens in conjunction with many partners, including the Central City Improvement District (CCID) and we have seen positive results. We are pleased to note that the levels of crime have dropped significantly in the Company&rsquo;s Garden, making this a safe space for all to enjoy." &nbsp;Muneeb Hendricks, manager for Safety and Security at the CCID, said the revitalisation of the restaurant area in the Company&rsquo;s Garden has also seen increased numbers of people visiting.&nbsp;&ldquo;These results in the space being more populated increasingly eliminate the opportunity for would-be criminals to commit crime. The new restaurant is very popular and many visitors enjoy this facility. &ldquo;This has had a positive effect and there have been no reports of crime in and around the area,&rdquo; said Hendricks. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
