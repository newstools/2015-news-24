Pietermaritzburg - A 27-year-old man is on the run after police pounced on his home in Gezubuso, on the outskirts of Pietermaritzburg and found stolen cars and car parts. Yesterday afternoon Taylor’s Halt police received information about stolen cars being stripped at the house. Police spokesperson Mthokozisi ­Ngobese said, “When the police got to the home of the suspect they found a Toyota Avanza which was reported stolen at the Umbilo police station and a Mazda 323 which had been stripped. It could not be identified because the engine number and serial number had been scratched out.” According to a source, the suspect is a well-known man in the area. “We have never suspected anything because when asked about these cars, he would say they belonged to a friend,” said the source. “The suspect is still on the run but we have arrested a 24-year-old woman for the possession of stolen goods,” said Ngobese. The woman told The Witness before she was arrested that she knew “nothing about this”. “I only came here last week to visit [the suspect]. I am from Dambuza. It’s the first time I have seen these items.” According to a neighbour, the suspect has never given anyone a reason not to trust him. “He is a very good child. This came as a shock to everyone,” said the neighbour.
