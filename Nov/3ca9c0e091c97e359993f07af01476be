Luzulane advised pupils from 26 high schools around Ingwe Local Municipality during Zazi campaign, which is aimed at teaching young girls to value themselves and to create awareness around issues that affect them. The campaign was held at Kevelaer Mission in Donnybrook recently, organised by the Department of Health in KZN in partnership with Operation Sukuma Sakhe stakeholders. The Zazi campaign is meant to reduce the percentage of young women who engage in sexual relationships with older partners. It is also meant to achieve zero new HIV/Aids and TB infections and deaths due to TB, HIV and Aids, Luzulane said. This campaign intensifies our efforts to fight the abuse of women and children. We say no to unprotected sex, we say no to sugar-daddy relationships, she added. Department of Health District Manager, Mrs L. Zuma said the programme sought to target male and female pupils that will help spread the message across communities and become ambassadors of the programme. She said the campaign will also empower pupils to make better choices.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
