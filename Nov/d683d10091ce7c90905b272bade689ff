Egyptian authorities have jailed thousands of suspected members of the Brotherhood and the courts have sentenced hundreds to death since then.Secular activists have also been jailed for violating a law curbing demonstrations.The travel restrictions however apply to a broader swathe of citizens more broadly, from politicians and activists heading to conferences to a group wanting to travel to Germany for training on combating violence against women, the report found.Egyptian security agencies have increasingly taken measures to prevent those they consider dissidents from traveling, the report found, from requiring security clearances, to placing individuals on travel bans, to confiscating passports.Most travellers have been turned away at passport control without an explanation and without prior notice, said the report."The Egyptian government's opaque travel restriction policy violates both the Egyptian constitution and international human rights law," said the report.President Abdel Fattah Sisi was elected in 2014 on a mandate of restoring political stability and economic growth to a country rocked by years of turbulence following the 2011 uprising. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
