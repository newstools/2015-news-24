There was a little snake laying under the hose that I didn't see," she said."It was laying there in the sun. I didn't take any notice until I felt the sting."Her brave cat Skitzo came to the rescue."She came out stalking and it looked like she was mesmerising it and then she just went in for the kill."I turned the snake over and saw the red belly and thought `Oh, that's not a very friendly one'."Having been bitten by snakes three times before she knew what to do and bound the wound on her swelling hand, stayed still and called an ambulance. Fortunately, the snake did not inject any venom when it bit."Just be careful and wear your glasses when you go outside - that helps," she said when asked for advice about dealing with snakes.And so does having a brave cat like Skitzo.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
