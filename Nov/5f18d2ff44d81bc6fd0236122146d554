Dumisani.ZondiTHERE likely will be no load shedding until at least May 2016, Eskom CEO Brian Molefe said recently.While maintenance on Eskom s ageing fleet has been increased, the power utility has managed to stave off implementing load shedding for more than 80 days. We are doing all that maintenance without load shedding, Molefe said. We will step up our maintenance in December as everyone goes on holiday. We will add quite a lot of units to the maintenance programme to catch up on backlog. We do not anticipate load shedding until at least 30 April [2016], he said, adding that Eskom is working on overcoming the maintenance backlog ahead of the winter season.Molefe told Parliament that Eskom was celebrating 50 days of no load shedding and 87 days where only two-and-a-half hours of load shedding took place. After July, load reductions and load shedding has been very minimal, he said. Going forward it won t be necessary to update [the public on these daily load shedding stats], as having electricity will become a normal thing, he said.While Eskom has been congratulated on alleviating load shedding, electricity usage has dropped dramatically since the start of 2015.This has raised concerns that Eskom has avoided implementing load shedding because of this drop in usage.
