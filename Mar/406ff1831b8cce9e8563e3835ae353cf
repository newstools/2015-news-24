Johannesburg - Public Protector Thuli Madonsela suspects that the reason behind a decision to probe spy claims against her, is to create a situation in which she could face suspension, according to reports. Madonsela told Radio 702 that the reason she did not want the allegations to be investigated was that those who requested the probe, were the same people claimed to have been requested by the security agencies to dig these things about her. Sapa reported that allegations of espionage against Madonsela, Â EFF leader Julius Malema, former DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko and Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union president Joseph Mathunjwa made on social media would be investigated by the state security agency (SSA). According to Eyewitness News the public protector said she was shocked that government was still pushing the investigation. She told the news organisation that she thought that the motive was to make her ask for an investigation and then for the president to have a reason to request her to go on a sabbatical or for the president to suspend her pending an investigation. SSA spokesperson Brian Dube said last week: "A search conducted on these allegations made, led government to the following website: africainteligenceleaks.wordpress.com, including other social media platforms. "The State Security Agency looked at the matter with great concern, as these allegations will impact negatively on our hard-won democracy and will undermine the independence and credibility of our democratic institutions." Madonsela has since rubbished these allegations and said: "A Grade 9 pupil could see it is rubbish." Madonsela said she would lodge a formal complaint against the SSA and ask it to withdraw the statement. She said it was "interesting" that it surfaced days before President Jacob Zuma answered questions in Parliament.
