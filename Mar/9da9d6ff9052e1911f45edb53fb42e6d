More teargas rounds followed, sending the packed crowds stampeding.Official forensic reports said that the fans had died of injuries due to the crushing stampede, although a forensic official earlier said that asphyxiation from tear gas was also a factor in the deaths.An Amnesty International report said that police, unable to hold back pushing crowds, started beating fans and then shot tear gas horizontally into them.Tuesday's prosecution statement said that the Muslim Brotherhood had provided funds and explosives to members of the White Knights group to bring about a riot.Prosecutors said that the White Knights members had set off fireworks at police, causing several injuries, and chanted insults against them, leading to the police response that caused the stampede.The Islamists hoped that a riot at the match would lead to the failure of a high profile investment conference that was held this weekend, the statement said.Excessive use of powerProsecutors also referred a police officer to trial on charges of shooting a young socialist activist dead in Cairo in January.Shaimaa al-Sabbagh was shot in Cairo's central Talaat Harb Square on the eve of the anniversary of the 2011 revolution against long time leader Hosni Mubarak.She was taking part in a small procession organised by the Popular Socialist Alliance party to lay a wreath on a memorial to the martyrs of the revolution in Tahrir Square.Party members and leaders who participated in the procession are also to face trial on charges of holding an unauthorized protest and disturbing security, the prosecution said.The party on Saturday accused police of storming and ransacking its offices in Alexandria. The interior ministry denied the accusation.Under a law passed in November 2013, a few months after then army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi, protests are effectively banned without police authorisation.Amnesty International said in February that at least 1 400 protesters had been killed in excessive use of force by security forces since Morsi's ouster, without any security officers being held accountable.Authorities have accused demonstrators of initiating violence in many of those cases. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
