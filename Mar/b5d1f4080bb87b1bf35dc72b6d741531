"The ministerial council has agreed to stop an imposed tax on travelers," said a statement from his office.Essid's hoped-for economic reforms, including boosting development and jobs, will not be easy in a country which is reliant on tourism, has few natural resources, suffers from high unemployment and offers generous state subsidies.Adding to the government's problems, tens of thousands of teachers went on strike on Monday and boycotted student exams to push for higher wages. The education ministry has rejected the demand, saying the budget did not allow for a pay hike.Analysts said if the government agreed to raise teachers' pay, it may be forced to make more concessions in other sectors.Public wages account for about a third of the state budget and Tunisia's powerful UGTT labor union started negotiations with the government last week to increase salaries for some 800 000 public sector workers.A deal is expected by the end of March. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
