Water for the huge tobacco farm will be drawn from the Zambezi River, whose water is shared by several countries.The tobacco grown is solely for export.In the advertisement, the ministry invited "interested parties to lodge with the Communal Land Board within seven days any [written] objection regarding the applications listed".The seven-day deadline ended Monday afternoon.Citing agricultural crop farming projects of the government under the national 'Green Scheme', Amupanda noted that the envisaged tobacco farm would cover more land than all Green Scheme projects together."There are a total of 8259 hectares cultivated under Green Scheme irrigation, whereas the planned tobacco farm would be 10 000 ha for tobacco," Amupanda objected in his letter with the letterhead "Land Activists".The tobacco farm is planned by a Chinese investor 'Namibia Oriental Tobacco cc', which is believed to act as agency for the HongyunHonghe Tobacco Group situated in China's Yunnan Province.HongyunHonghe Tobacco launched a cigarette-processing unit for Africa at Namibia's port of Walvis Bay two years ago to produce Honghe cigarette brands for sale in Africa. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
