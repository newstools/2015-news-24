It was expected that no party would get enough votes to govern alone and that Lesotho would get another coalition government.Power strugglesTwenty-four parties vied for support among the 1.2 million registered voters in the country, which is landlocked by South Africa.The elections were agreed with the mediation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) after soldiers surrounded Thabane's residence and police headquarters on 30 August. One police officer was killed.The army justified the move by saying it had intended to disarm rogue elements within the police force, but SADC said the events resembled a coup.Thabane fled to South Africa and returned to Lesotho under a South African police escort.The premier's three-party coalition government ran into trouble in June 2014, when Metsing announced a vote of no confidence against him, prompting him to dissolve parliament.Analysts say the strife could be related to Thabane's anti-corruption campaign, which threatened to implicate Metsing. The deputy premier has denied involvement in a coup attempt.Critics say the government had focused on power struggles rather than on improving the lives of the people, nearly 60% of whom live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
