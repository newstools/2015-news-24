Sentencing would take place on 17 April.Shabangu said government was pleased that justice had been served and law enforcement agencies had, through hard work and dedication, proven that government would not tolerate abuse and violence against women and children."South Africans can and must do more to stop rape, human trafficking and all forms of abuse. Together, with government we must transform existing gender relations in our families and communities."Victims of violence and abuse, including harmful cultural practices, were encouraged to call the social development department's 24-hour call centre on 0800 428 428. It was dedicated to providing support and counselling to victims of gender-based violence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
