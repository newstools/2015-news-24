Those people are clowns. Our biggest problem is that our 'intelligence' is not intelligent."Mathunjwa, president of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), said it was "rubbish" and a "waste of state resources" to investigate such allegations.Mazibuko, former Democratic Alliance parliamentary leader who is studying at Harvard, tweeted: "It's pretty embarrassing that a SA cabinet minister would issue a press statement responding to a false blog post from the lunatic fringe" followed by a "sad face" emoticon.Claims include that the CIA in Langley, US, has a file on Mazibuko saying she is trying to organise a "Pretoria version of the Arab spring".24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
