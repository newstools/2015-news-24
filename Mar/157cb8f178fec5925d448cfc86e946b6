	     Johannesburg - The case against a Somali shop owner
arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a Soweto teenager was
postponed in the Protea Magistrate's Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday. After a very brief appearance before Magistrate Herman
Badenhorst, Alodixashi Sheik Yusuf was told to return to court on 28 April as
investigations continued. Yusuf was arrested after Siphiwe Mahori, 14, was shot
dead outside his shop in Snake Park, Soweto, on Monday, 19 January. Yusuf had allegedly fired at a group of people trying to
rob his shop. The shooting sparked a wave of looting of foreign-owned
shops. It spread from Soweto to Kagiso on the West Rand and Sebokeng in the
Vaal, causing several deaths, including a baby boy who was trampled by a group
of looters. Yusuf was released on bail of R2 000 when he appeared in
court last month. "Facts before me show you might be guilty of
culpable homicide and not murder," Badenhorst told him at the time. "Circumstantial evidence supports the accused's
version [that] he shot two warning shots through the roof and one at the closed
door."   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
