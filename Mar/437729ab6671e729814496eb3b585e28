We are busy in discussions with other players in the sector. We will either go alone or buy into existing players in the sector,&rdquo; Kagiso Trust chief executive Kgotso Shoeman said.He said Kagiso Capital, an investment arm of the trust, had identified an opening in the market for private education in South Africa&rsquo;s townships.&ldquo;We know we will play a huge role in the space. We are in talks with provincial governments to lease empty schools in order to take private and affordable education into the townships. There is a huge growth into the sector. The middle class is going to pay for the education of their children, but we want to make it affordable for them.&rdquo;The business plan has not been finalised, but whatever is done has to be affordable and accessible, he said.&ldquo;They will be schools that anyone in the township who has prioritised education should be able to afford.&rdquo;In the past five years South Africa has seen an explosion of low-fee private schools, primarily driven by government education that is seen as substandard.The biggest player in the sector is Curro, which has a number of schools catering for different segments of the middle class.Last year Pearson also announced that it would invest about R28m to establish a chain of low-fee private schools.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
