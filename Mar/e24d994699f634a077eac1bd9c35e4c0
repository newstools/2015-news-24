Cypriot national George Louca, accused of the murder of Teazers boss Lolly Jackson, has lung cancer. “It appears on the face of it to be quite extensive,” his lawyer Owen Blumberg was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper. “If it is a really aggressive cancer and he doesn’t have much time, I can’t anticipate what direction the court will take [in the murder trial].” Louca was expected to undergo a series of tests to determine the stage of the disease. Blumberg said Louca provided affidavits to the state, but he was concerned that his client may not survive to testify and prove his claims of innocence. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Velekhaya Mgobhozi said the NPA was waiting for a report from the defence team. “The NPA will study the report and make a decision,” he told the newspaper. National police spokesperson Lieutenant General Solomon Makgale said investigators were also waiting for the report. “We have adopted a wait-and-see attitude,” he said. Louca is on trial, under the name George Smith, for allegedly killing Jackson. Jackson was shot dead in a house in Edleen, on the East Rand, on May 3 2010. At the time it was reported that Louca called then Gauteng police intelligence boss Joey Mabasa and confessed to the crime. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
