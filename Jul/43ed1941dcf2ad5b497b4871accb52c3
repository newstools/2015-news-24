"The southern Cape area will have heavy [rain] fall on Friday. This could lead to flooding in some parts," SA Weather Service forecaster Jan Vermuelen told News24. "We do expect the heavy rains to move to the upper Eastern Cape and parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday." Vermuelen said there would be "disruptive snow" in Lesotho, the north eastern side of the Eastern Cape and possibly the northern side of the Western Cape on Friday and Saturday. "Disruptive snow means that, especially in those areas, roads could be closed," he said. "The snow could continue into Sunday morning." He said most of the country would also have isolated to scattered rain. READ: MAP - Gear up for a BIG snow week and weekend in SA 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
