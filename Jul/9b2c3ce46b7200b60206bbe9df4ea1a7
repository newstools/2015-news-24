The next day soldiers attacked police headquarters, looting weapons and killing one officer.Thabane described the violence as a coup attempt, though both his political opponents and the military denied any bid to seize power.SADC instructed both Mahao and Kamoli to leave the country in the run-up to a snap election in February, which brought a new coalition government to power headed by Thabane's predecessor, Pakalitha Mosisili.Kamoli was reinstated as army chief after the election.Completely landlocked by South Africa, Lesotho is one of the world's poorest countries and is no stranger to political upheaval.The SADC leaders also created a special panel that would act as early warning mechanism to watch out for signs of instability and intervene appropriately. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
