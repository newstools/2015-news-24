He said the ongoing power cuts were an indication that the ANC lacked capacity."The ANC must take responsibility and stop blaming apartheid," Malema said.Speaking at the Olympia Stadium in Rustenburg where his party held its second anniversary rally, Malema&nbsp;expressed confidence in the growth of the EFF. "The EFF is everywhere... We have taken Rustenburg, when Blade Nzimande is drinking red wine. We are distributing red T-shirt," Malema said.He said Nzimande, who is the SA Communist Party secretary general, had set the Young Communist League to kill the EFF."We challenged him to ask YCL to fill a hall in Soweto. If they do we will not talk to them. We are not afraid of death. We in fact want Blade, not the non-existing&nbsp;YCL," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
