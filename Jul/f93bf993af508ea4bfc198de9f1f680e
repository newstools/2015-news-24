	     Cape Town - The Huguenot Tunnel on the N1 in the Western Cape was closed after strong winds overturned four trucks near the tunnel on Tuesday, provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said.  "Currently the tunnel is closed because of strong cross winds," he told News24. No one was hurt in the incidents.  Africa said the winds were expected to continue throughout the night, and were in fact getting stronger.  He said Bain's Kloof Pass was also closed because the winds had uprooted trees, which were strewn across the road.  Africa said motorists would have to use alternative routes, including the old Du Toits Kloof Pass.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
