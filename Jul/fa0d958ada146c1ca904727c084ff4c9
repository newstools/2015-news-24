He is barred from leaving his residential or work address without permission.&nbsp;Mokhua appeared before the professional conduct committee of the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) in 2013 where he was found guilty of gross misconduct. The HPCSA barred him from running a private practice for five years but allowed him to continue working in public hospitals.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
