Adverts had been placed in newspapers inviting interested parties to bid for the new three-year contract, spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said. “Companies have shown an interest and the service to motorists should not be affected.” Provision had been made for the new company to employ the current pointsmen. Insurance company Outsurance had been sponsoring them for the past few years. The successful bidder pays their salaries and provides their uniforms and motorbikes. The metro police train them. “It’s standard that when the contract expires there must be an advert for companies to bid to apply, so that it’s fair,” Minnaar said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
