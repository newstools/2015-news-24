"More importantly we appeal to the law enforcement agencies to ensure a speedy prosecution of those who are alleged to be guilty of these deaths."The commission commended traditional leaders who worked with police to rescue children found in illegal initiation schools.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
