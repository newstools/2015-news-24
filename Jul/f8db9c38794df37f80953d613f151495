"Those who still can afford it, now spend twice as much as they did just a few months ago."Last year, at least 167 people died in a cholera outbreak that was later contained.The civil war began in December 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of planning a coup, setting off a cycle of retaliatory killings that has split the poverty-stricken, landlocked country along ethnic lines.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
