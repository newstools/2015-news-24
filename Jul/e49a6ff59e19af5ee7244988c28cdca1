According to the woman&rsquo;s statement, she started chatting to a man on social chat service WhatsApp in May this year.The man was known to her as Frans Segwaba, which police have now found to be a false name, and he told her that he was a neurosurgeon at Netcare.After two months of online romance, the two decided to meet in Bergview last week.The next day, the man proposed that she should escort him to Durban so that she could meet his parents.On Sunday morning, it is alleged that Segwaba left his car with a friend for it to be repaired, and the couple made a quick coffee stop at St Anne&rsquo;s Hospital as he needed to drop off an item with a colleague.While drinking their coffee, it is alleged that Segwaba excused himself from the table to meet his friend, taking Machesa&rsquo;s car keys without her knowledge.Machesa said in her statement to police that she waited three hours for the man to return, but he never did.She was unable to call as they had both left their phones in the car, after she was told that it would only be a quick hospital visit.When Machesa went to the car park, her car was gone and both her phone and Segwaba&rsquo;s phone were turned off.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
