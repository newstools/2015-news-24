Among them are 30 Britons," said the ministry's director of emergency services, Naoufal Somrani.The bodies of eight Britons were being flown home and were set to arrive later on Wednesday at a Royal Air Force station north of London, officials said."This will be the first of a number of repatriations into RAF Brize Norton," the British Foreign Office said in a statement.'A response at home and abroad'Friday's death toll was the worst loss of life for Britain in a jihadist attack since the July 2005 bombings in London.Cameron has promised to back a full investigation, calling for "a response at home and abroad" to violent Islamic fundamentalism.British police have also sent forensic experts to Tunisia to help local teams probing the attack.The 25 British tourists who were wounded have already been flown home, while 4 000 terrified holidaymakers were repatriated at the weekend. Another 1 900 are due to return home in the coming days.The gunman, who witnesses say deliberately targeted tourists at the beach resort, had received weapons training from jihadists in chaos-wracked Libya, a top official said on Tuesday.Secretary of State for Security Rafik Chelli told AFP that Rezgui had been in Libya at the same time as the two men behind the Bardo museum attack."It is confirmed that he (Rezgui) went to Libya illegally. He was trained in Sabratha (west of Tripoli)," Chelli said."They were away at the same time... In Sabratha, there is only one camp that trains young Tunisians," he said, although he could not confirm whether all three jihadists had trained together.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
