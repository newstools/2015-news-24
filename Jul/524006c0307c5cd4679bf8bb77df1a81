From the beginning I said to him, &lsquo;President, prepare yourself for repayment.&rsquo; This was before the [Public Protector] report came out," Maharaj said in an interview posted on the publication's website on Friday.&nbsp;"And I said, &lsquo;If you have a problem, I&rsquo;m sure that in your present position it won&rsquo;t be difficult to raise [the money]&rsquo;. He said, &lsquo;No I did not ask for those security enhancements. I&rsquo;m not paying.&rsquo;&nbsp;"We know how stubborn each of us can be. And we know each of us has a blind spot. But however this thing pans out, what is important is we create a culture of taking responsibility for our actions.&rdquo;Maharaj told News24 on Sunday morning that he should be contacted for comment on the interview later in the day.&nbsp;Maharaj told The Sunday Times that he said it had been inappropriate for him to reveal confidential information about his relationship with Zuma.&nbsp;He told the Sunday Times he concluded his answer to the Financial Times with: "...The matter of Nkandla is still with Parliament and the possibly the courts. There is much contestation between the parties on this matter and I do not want my personal views arising from a confidential relationship to become a political football."A report by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, which was released in March last year, found that Zuma "unduly benefited" from some of the estimated R246m upgrades to his homestead.&nbsp;She said he should pay for those features that were not related to security.&nbsp;On May 28, Police Minister Nathi Nhleko released his own report on the Nkandla upgrades saying features at the homestead like the amphitheatre and soil retention wall, visitors&rsquo; centre, &ldquo;firepool&rdquo;, a kraal and a culvert, were all security features and he maintained that Zuma did not have to pay for these.Media were expected to tour the government facilities in the Nkandla homestead later on Sunday.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was after the SA National Editors' Forum said it was disappointed by the limited access journalists had during a parliamentary committee oversight visit to Zuma's home on Wednesday.&nbsp;Maharaj also told the Financial Times that he thought deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa would make a good president.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fantastic negotiator, he&rsquo;s got an enormous capacity to stay focused on 10 issues. I think he will probably make a good president, [although] I&rsquo;m not ruling out that even when he becomes president you find some major cock-up takes place.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
