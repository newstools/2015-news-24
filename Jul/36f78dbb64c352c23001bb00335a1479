This comes after Loonat was &ldquo;ousted&rdquo; a month ago from his position as Lansdowne CPF chairperson (&ldquo;CPF chair ousted&rdquo;, People&rsquo;s Post, 16 June). He was then re-elected two weeks ago and over the weekend, during a CPF cluster election, he was elected as cluster chairperson. The police stations that are part of the cluster are Grassy Park, Lansdowne, Mitchell&rsquo;s Plain, Steenberg, Athlone, Lentegeur, Strandfontein and Phillipi. Loonat says he is very excited about his new position and he plans big things in his tenure. &ldquo;This is one step forward for me. I plan to get back into community policing in a big way again,&rdquo; Loonat says. He adds his plans for CPFs in the cluster is to work together and ensure that everyone &ldquo;is on the same page&rdquo;.&ldquo;We need to foster a relationship between neighbouring CPFs where the one will assist the other in community policing duties. This is the only way we can take back our communities,&rdquo; he says. Neighbourhood watches will also form part of his focus, he says. &ldquo;We will make sure they understand their mandates. Plans will also be set in place to ensure these bodies get the necessary training,&rdquo; he says. V What are your thoughts? Starting with the word &ldquo;Post&rdquo;, SMS your views to 32516.
