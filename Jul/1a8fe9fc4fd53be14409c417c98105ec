The man, who would not been named for fear of victimisation, said he received a letter from the uMngeni Municipality in April, shortly after he filed an opposition against his new property valuation, stating he needed to fill out forms at the municipality in order to proceed. “I went to the municipality to complete the form and was then told I needed to pay a fee of R342. I paid the amount, but nowhere on the letter did it state that a fee needed to be paid.” He said in continuing his opposition to the valuation, he was told to fill out another form with the municipality in June to continue the process. “The second form was basically a repetition of the first form I filled out, but this time I was told to pay a fee of R906. “Again, there was no mention of a fee in the letter I received.” He said the R906 was a large sum for many to come up with, especially without knowing about the fee prior to filling out forms. “The fee to object to property valuations should not be so high. Everyone should be able to object and afford to object to property valuations,” he said. uMngeni municipal spokesperson Thando Mgaga said yesterday that there had been a community meeting in February to discuss the process, and there had been notices from the municipality in the local media. “Municipal notices outlining the objection fees have been published in local media and in The Witness. It is important to note that these fees are completely refundable if the objection or appeal is in favour of the property owner,” he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
