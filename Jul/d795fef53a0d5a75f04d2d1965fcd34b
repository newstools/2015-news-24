Our priority right now is reaching the most vulnerable children who urgently need clean water and vaccinations," Veitch said.Health Minister Riek Gai Kok said last month that one of the casualties had died at a United Nations facility housing civilians seeking refuge from the civil war raging in the world's youngest nation state.The conflict pits forces loyal to President Salva Kiir against rebels allied with former vice president Riek Machar, and more than 10 000 people have been killed since the fighting first erupted in December 2013.The conflict has also created a humanitarian crisis, as more than 730 000 people have fled to neighbouring countries and some 1.5 million people have been uprooted within the country, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.At least 167 people died in South Sudan in a cholera outbreak last year, according to the World Health Organisation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
