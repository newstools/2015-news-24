"I want to thank the president for this surprise gesture."Among those freed were former justice minister Momodou Lamin Jobarteh and former police chief Ensa Badjie, jailed for alleged corruption and drug trafficking respectively.Amnesty International, one of several rights groups that has expressed concern about growing repression in Gambia, welcomed the release."However, we are aware that just a few weeks ago prisoners who were released were rounded up again and taken back to prison," said researcher Sabrina Mahtani. Gambia said it released 85 prisoners during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.The government has denied a deterioration in civil liberties and says the re-arrests that Amnesty referred to were due to a mix-up over four names.The Mile 2 prison has gained notoriety among residents and rights groups for its secrecy.
