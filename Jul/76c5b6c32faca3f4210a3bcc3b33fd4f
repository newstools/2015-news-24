Constable salaries start at R8 000. Ten on-the-ground staffers could be employed from that one pay check,&rdquo; he told News24.&ldquo;Yes, they perform a dangerous and critical service within our communities. But when it comes down to the bottom line, we need more men on the ground.&rdquo;According to a SJC report on policing in Khayelitsha, Camps Bay &ndash; one of the safest areas in the province with a population of 4 592 &ndash; had 959 police personnel per 10 000 people. This compared to Harare, one of the poorest areas in the Western Cape with a population of 173 342, which had 111 per 100 000 people.&ldquo;The numbers say it all,&rdquo; Loonat said. &ldquo;A sustainable solution to the limited number of men in blue needs to be found.&ldquo;Some areas need more manpower than others. It is of utmost importance to get more people into the ranks so that officers can be assigned to where they are needed most.&rdquo;Performance assessments should determine salary increases and not years of experience, Loonat insisted.&ldquo;Hard work, arrests and convictions should be rewarded with bonuses and incentives. This will motivate the force to work harder and smarter instead of choosing corruption to fill their pockets.&ldquo;Policemen are there to protect and serve. It is a calling... but the salaries currently being issued to those higher up need to be relooked at.&ldquo;The only numbers that should matter now is the number of cops on our streets.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
