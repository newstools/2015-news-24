SABC News tweeted that Sibiya, who has been suspended since January, was found guilty of two of the charges he was facing in a disciplinary hearing. According to eNCA, he was accused of planning and executing the 2010 operation that led to the illegal repatriation of five Zimbabweans. In June, a police crime intelligence sergeant insisted that Sibiya was present at the arrest of a group of Zimbabweans allegedly subjected to an illegal rendition. This contrasts with letters presented by Sibiya's counsel Paul Kennedy, recommending that a completely different group of policemen be commended for the arrests, as well as a letter of gratitude from Zimbabwean police. The arrests are believed to have been carried out so that the deportees could be handed to Zimbabwean authorities as suspects for a murder on September 18, 2010 of a police superintendent in Bulawayo, and for injuring several patrons at a restaurant during that shooting. Sibiya has denied giving any order, or that he was at the scene, and has said previously that it was former colleague Lieutenant General Richard Mdluli trying to get him back for the investigation he conducted against Mduli for the murder of a love rival. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
