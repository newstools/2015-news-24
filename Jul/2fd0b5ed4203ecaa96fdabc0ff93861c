Earl Haupt A new minstrel group out of Silvertown, aiming to equip community youth members with life skills through the gift of music, is seeking support from the community.Imvusa Cape Town Minstrels, established earlier this year, have created a multi-cultural atmosphere whereby youth can occupy themselves with music, whilst also being made aware of their rights.Imvusa, which means new beginning , hope to enter a troupe of 500 members, with members from all around the Cape, including from as far away as Wellington.The group belong to the Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association (KKKA) and will participate at Vygieskraal stadium. Imvusa Trading is currently on board to help financing, however, according to member and spokesperson William Albertus, the group are calling on businesses in an effort to minimise expenses. We are currently in the early stages of planning our yearly events for 2016. Many of these kids have never taken part in the coon carnival, he said.The group maintain that they are focussed on keeping the youth away from the influences of drugs and gangsterism. Our main aim is to support the youth in our community in singing and playing an instrument that will take them off the streets. We would also love to feed and clothe the underprivileged as part of our community project. The success of our organization is dependant entirely upon the financial and product support of corporations and private sponsors.
