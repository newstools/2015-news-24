Last year in March, we recorded the front seat at a temperature of 73 degrees.&ldquo;When it was a 20-degree day outside, we found the back seat of the car reached 49 degrees. That is too hot for anyone to sit in.&rdquo;Luthuli said based on the photographs and third party evidence from the case where two young children where locked in their parents&rsquo; car outside Liberty Midlands Mall two weeks ago, she estimated that they were subjected to a temperature of around 46 degrees while waiting for the parents to come out of the mall.&ldquo;Here in Pietermaritzburg when the relative humidity is 40% and it is 26 degrees outside, the university&rsquo;s Agrometeorology site releases a warning of caution for the possibility of heat-related illness.&ldquo;In a car, temperatures reach way beyond that and children are much more susceptible to heat compared to adults and therefore have a much higher risk of suffering heat exhaustion or dehydration.&rdquo;According to Luthuli&rsquo;s data, cooler days are not exempt from high temperatures in the car and leaving your child in the car on a cooler day can prove just as dangerous as leaving a child in the car on a hot day.Pietermaritzburg SPCA senior inspector Rose Stafford said animals were affected just as adversely by the heat in a car as children were.&ldquo;A hot car is not a dog-friendly environment. Temperatures sky-rocket in a car and dogs, like children, can suffer from severe heatstroke and in some cases, even death, from sitting in a locked car.&ldquo;If you love your dog, leave them at home. It is not in a dog&rsquo;s best interest to sit in a hot, locked car,&rdquo; she said.Stafford said the SPCA would investigate any allegations of animals being locked in cars and encouraged people to phone the SPCA as soon as they sighted a dog locked in a car.She also encouraged people to photograph the dog in the car and take down the car&rsquo;s licence plate in case the SPCA arrived after the car had left.&ldquo;We will definitely investigate anyone who has left their dog in a hot car. The SPCA totally disapproves of such behaviour.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
