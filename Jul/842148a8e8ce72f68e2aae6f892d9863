It is advised that newly licensed drivers also attend an advanced driving course that will teach them the many facets of safe driving. Experts say young and inexperienced drivers are likely to drive faster than the speed limit, leading to collisions. A new driver is more likely to crash in the first year after passing the driving test than at any other time.Alexander Forbes Insurance has advised young drivers to consider taking an advanced or defensive driving course and to build a safe-driving history to benefit from low premium rates for vehicle insurance.The state puts out road-blocks and spends millions on overtime for traffic cops, but the South African road-death toll continues to climb. Completing an advanced driving course will definitely better your driving skills. Gary Ronald of the Automobile Association of SA commented: &ldquo;The real focus is not just the skills to pass the K53 but the skills needed to survive on our roads.&ldquo;Little has been done in South Africa to create change or prevent road deaths during the busiest times of the year.&rdquo;Considering the driving styles, risky driving techniques and overall lack of concern for the safety of others (and, without realising it, themselves) an advanced driving course could prove to be extremely beneficial.First, a safe driving distance - how long a car takes to stop from the speeds being driven at on our freeways - and overall driving position are probably the most under-rated and neglected factors of post-test driving.
