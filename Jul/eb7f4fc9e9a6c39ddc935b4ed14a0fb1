Whatever he is smoking is certainly playing havoc with his mental faculties. For anyone to suggest that Robert Mugabe is not to blame for the problems in Zimbabwe, that person would be clearly of unsound mind," Gutu was quoted as saying.Another MDC faction led by Welshman Ncube also laid into Malema, with the secretary for international relations, Kurauone Chihwayi, saying his statements were sickening. A New Zimbabwe.com report quoted Chihwayi as saying that Malema&rsquo;s remarks "betray a serious lack of understanding of the Zimbabwean situation or a deep hatred for the people of Zimbabwe".Land reform system Chihwayi said it was "baffling" for Malema to defend Mugabe when he and his Zanu-PF party had presided over the suffering of Zimbabweans through the mismanagement of the country over the past 35 years.This was not the first time that Malema praised Mugabe. In 2014 Malema defended Mugabe's "controversial" land reform programme, saying South Africa "must learn" from the southern African country.Malema at the time showered Mugabe with praise, saying there was no land reform system that had worked successfully for Africa other than Zimbabwe's land reform programme.Malema said the Zimbabwean policy on land reform was a lesson to be learnt from and to be implemented in South Africa, "except the initial violent method of attacking white people or attacking each other". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
