“Which 9-year-old boy does not want to play with a sword?” So muses 19-year-old Robert McGregor, who is currently the top-ranked u.20 men’s foilist in the country. McGregor, a Constantia resident, is one of three Western Cape foilists who will participate in the Commonwealth Fencing Junior Championships for u.20 which will take place at the University of Cape Town’s sports centre from Saturday to Friday next week. The city is the first African host of the championships, which will attract participants from 14 countries. McGregor has competed in five junior world championships and two junior African championships and has been fencing for 10 years. “After watching fencing at the Olympic Games on television I was inspired. Fortunately, the school I attended at the time offered fencing as a sport,” he says. McGregor says that in having taken part in the international and African junior championships and being a seasoned competition he “does not plan on underestimating the opposing countries”. “We will be competing against the likes of Australia, Canada, England and Singapore, who have very strong competitors, but we have a fighting chance and intend to perform and perform well,” he says
