I have to proclaim, democracy is not just formal elections," he added, to cheers from the packed hall, with all its 2 500 seats taken by AU officials as well as civil society representatives."When journalists are put behind bars for doing their jobs, or activists are threatened as governments crack down on civil society, then you may have democracy in name, but not in substance."I am convinced that nations cannot realise the full promise of independence until they fully protect the rights of their people." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
