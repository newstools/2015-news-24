Some of the items were stolen at the weekend."The department is extremely concerned that valuable resources, which are meant to enhance the delivery of quality education to learners, are seen by some as an opportunity to feed their criminal deeds and rob our learners of their right to quality basic education," spokesperson Phumla Sekhonyane said.She said a criminal case had been opened and the matter was currently being investigated.Sekhonyane said the department would strengthen security at the school and also install a high tech security system."The police have also undertaken to assist with patrols."The project has distributed equipment to Grade 12 learners in 375 schools across Gauteng and has also seen the installation of smart interactive boards in Grade 12 classrooms.Sekhonyane said the theft of the tablets and other e-learning equipment only served to reverse the progress government had made to lift the standard of quality education and the department's standard of delivery."The department would like to categorically state that it remains committed and determined to realise its vision...&nbsp;to build a world-class education system by modernising public education and improving the standard of performance of the entire system."No amount of thuggery will deter our efforts in attaining this vision." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
