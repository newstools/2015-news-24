The attacks came days after state prosecutor Hisham Barakat was assassinated in a car bombing, the most senior government official killed in the jihadist insurgency, prompting Sisi to demand tougher laws and faster trials for alleged militants.Hundreds of soldiers and policemen have been killed by militants since Morsi's overthrow, while at least 1 400 people, mostly Islamists, have lost their lives during a police crackdown on protesters.While policemen have largely been cleared of wrongdoing in the deadly crackdown, the law would grant them further protection from prosecution over abuses, according to critics.Rights group Amnesty International said the draft law "represents a flagrant attack on the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association" and "weakens safeguards to ensure fair trials and widens the use of the death penalty"."If approved, it is set to become yet another tool for the authorities to crush all forms of dissent," said Said Boumedouha, deputy director of the group's Middle East and North Africa programme.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
