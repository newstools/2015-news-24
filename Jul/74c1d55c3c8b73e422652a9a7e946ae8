Table Mountain Watch spokesperson, Andre van Schalkwyk, said foreigners, some believed to be from Ireland and France, were descending around 16:00 on Sunday when two men with knives confronted them. “Their backpacks, passports and valuables were taken.” He said he was frustrated that hikers had struggled to get hold of the police and lodge cases. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed that three robbery cases were opened at Cape Town Central police station on Sunday. No arrests had been made. Van Schalkwyk said Lion’s Head had been “very quiet for some time” on the crime front. Last Sunday, a man with a knife threatened a group of students on the same path around 19:30. He robbed them of a digital camera and an undisclosed amount of cash before fleeing. He had yet to be arrested. Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) spokesperson Merle Collins recently told News24 that the park had a dedicated visitor safety team, made up of about 60 “highly qualified” rangers and 12 sniffer dogs. The team patrolled the mountain chain at all hours. “Yes, we do get occasional chancers but we’ve seen a significant drop in contact crime in the national park,” Collins said. Community safety MEC, Dan Plato, and his department were expected to meet with various affected parties soon, to discuss “the safety concerns raised and the impact of current safety interventions”. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
