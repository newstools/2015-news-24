	     Johannesburg - A school pupil was killed while “train surfing” in Soweto on Tuesday morning, Johannesburg emergency services said. The 19-year-old slipped and fell under the train’s wheels at the Chiawelo train station around 08:00, spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said. The teenager, a pupil at a high school in Orlando, was running along the station platform, jumping onto the train and hanging off the side, then jumping back onto the platform. He sustained multiple injuries and died on the scene. “His family have been informed and the school principal is on the scene,” Mulaudzi said. "We want to urge schoolchildren to refrain from doing this." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
