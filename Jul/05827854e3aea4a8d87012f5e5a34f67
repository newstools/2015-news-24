The Ixopo-based Christ the King Hospital nurse and doctor delivered triplets naturally two weeks ago, a first for the hospital.While one of the children named Sibusiso died just over a week later due to complications, two girls, named Busisiwe and Nombuso, are healthy but will remain in hospital under observation until they gain weight. Dr Siyabonga Ngozo, a medical manager at the hospital, said they were not aware the mother was going to deliver triplets and neither was she.&ldquo;This is why it is so important for every women to have at least one ultra-sound done. It is to predict these kinds of things.&ldquo;It helps to see the baby and it helps to determine the expected date of delivery,&rdquo; he said. He said the mother, Nosifiso Nyangana (23), had delivered before without complication.Nyangana, who was extremely shy, said while she was &ldquo;surprised&rdquo; she is happy with the children and can&rsquo;t wait to take them home. Ngozo said on July 5, the mother came to the hospital and she was already in labour.&ldquo;One of the doctors who had been on duty the night before noticed that it was a breach [when a baby is not coming out head-first] and she asked me to be there when the baby is delivered to make sure that there are no complications.&rdquo; He said there were only a &ldquo;few junior nurses&rdquo; who were &ldquo;terrified&rdquo;. &ldquo;I showed them two videos on how to deliver a breach but when the time came they all fled and I was left with one that I had to grab by the arm.&rdquo;He said they delivered the first baby and thought they were done, then the second came and then the third.&ldquo;Even the mother started crying. The boyfriend had only come with clothes for one baby. He fled when he heard three children had been born. He came back later,&rdquo; said Ngozo He said for a rural hospital to deliver triplets naturally was &ldquo;nothing short of a miracle&rdquo;. &ldquo;If I had known beforehand that she was delivering triplets, I would have performed a caesarean,&rdquo; he said24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
