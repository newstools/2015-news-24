One person was more serious and had to be taken to hospital," he said.He said the structure housed nearly 100 000 chicks, which were&nbsp;housed there from birth until they were 21 days old.The chickens either burnt to death or died from smoke inhalation before the structure collapsed on them.Pieterse said chemicals at the farm&nbsp;made the fire difficult&nbsp;to put out."Also, one of the problems is that there isn't a fire hydrant nearby. So we have to keep going up and down to the&nbsp;nearest one."He said an investigator would visit the farm on Tuesday to determine the cause of the fire." He said, however, that&nbsp;the blaze could have been&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the heaters used for the chicks or the lights inside the structure."The investigator will find out from the workers what happened."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
