It has since spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, causing millions of poultry infections and several hundred human deaths.Other West African countries including Benin, Cameroon, Mali and Togo have not identified bird flu cases and need to continue monitoring the situation to help prevent its spread, the FAO said.Local veterinary officials have been urged by the UN to try to trace where infected animals were sold to find sources of the outbreak in order to halt its spread.Poultry production has grown rapidly across West Africa in the past decade, the Ivory Coast alone has seen output expand by more than 60%, but regulatory systems haven't kept pace, the FAO said.The organisation is asking donors for $20m to respond to the avian flu outbreak and to help prevent its spread. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
