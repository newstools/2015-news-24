"Mama Winnie Mandela has taken a vow to be buried by those people [ANC], but she is with us. She does not have to sign up membership to belong to us. What we are advocating for is what she fought for," Malema told party supports at the EFF second anniversary rally in Rustenburg. He said Madikizela-Mandela is a fearless revolutionary fighter. "She approved the EFF, that is why we are fearless. If she did not approve of us, we were going to have doubts." Malema described Madikizela-Mandela as a beautiful woman who inspired him to choose a beautiful woman to marry. "Winnie is beautiful. I once kissed her... that is why when I marry I choose a woman close to her. My wife is close to Winnie's beauty," he said to the laughter of the crowd. He told the crowd that Madikizela-Mandela had wished them well in celebrating two years of existence. He slammed those who had predicted that the EFF would only survive a year. "The EFF is growing daily," Malema told his supporters. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
