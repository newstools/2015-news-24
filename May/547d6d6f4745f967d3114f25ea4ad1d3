He died on the school premises," said Dlamini. The three pupils, aged 18 and 19, were in police custody and expected to appear in the Vereeniging Magistrate's Court within 48 hours. Dlamini said police did not yet know what the motive for the stabbing was. Gauteng education department spokesperson Phumla Sekhonyane said the department was concerned about how the victim gained access "unlawfully"."As a result we are sending our school safety team to the school to assess the safety measures at the school and give recommendations on what we must put in place so that this doesn't occur again."Officials at the school and pupils had been asked to co-operate with the safety assessment, which would include establishing how a knife was brought into the school.Pupils who witnessed the stabbing had already received trauma debriefing and the school's officials, who were traumatised, were getting psycho-social support."We are very concerned," said Sekhonyane.This is the second stabbing of a school boy in the south of Johannesburg this week.The Lenasia Rising Sun reported that a 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death after a soccer match in nearby Zakaraiyya Park on Sunday.That incident was not on school grounds.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
