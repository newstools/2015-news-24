Others have opened in Malindi, Kijito Upele, Madema, Mazizini and Wete police stations."Having a police gender and children desk is an achievement, but we all need to stand against the problem," Khamis said at the recent launch of the Bububu Gender and Children desk."Are we happy to see our children abused? Are we ready to see our family members traumatised? Certainly not. We need to protect women and children."The initiative, which has received $3.2 million from the EU, aims to improve women and children rights by providing training and necessary support to the police force."I think more women will have a lot of confidence reporting cases of abuse to women police since they have been trained to specially handle such cases," said Ali.'Culture of shame and silence'A culture of shame and silence currently engulfing communities in Unguja and Pemba has made it difficult to measure the prevalence of violent assaults against women and children, women's rights groups said.A 21-year-old woman, who came to Zanzibar as a teenager in 2012 to work as a domestic maid in the Kiembe Samaki area is planning to file a complaint at Malindi police gender desk against a former boss whom she claims sexually abused her."The working conditions were so harsh. At some point my boss was forcing me to have sex with him, but when I refused he sacked me without paying me," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in Zanzibar. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
