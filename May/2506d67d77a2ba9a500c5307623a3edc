City of Cape Town mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, said the motorist allegedly lost control of his vehicle during a race and hit several traffic signs and poles along Old Strandfontein Road between Klip Road and Fifth Avenue. “The City of Cape Town’s traffic service closed the road as a result of the high number of spectators and residents crowding the accident scene. The motorist was declared dead on scene at approximately 3am,” he said. “I would like to extend my condolences to the victim’s family. Sadly, this was a tragedy that could have been avoided. "We take a lot of flak from motoring enthusiasts for our enforcement efforts, but I hope that this incident will help to make people realise just how dangerous illegal street racing is. “There were hundreds of spectators along Old Strandfontein Road when this incident occurred and I shudder to think how much worse the consequences could have been had any bystanders been hit,” Smith said. He reported that traffic officers also arrested two motorists for reckless and negligent driving in the Ottery area on Saturday evening, as well as 12 others for driving under the influence of alcohol. “They issued 407 fines for various offences and suspended 28 vehicles for being unroadworthy.” “Operations in Ravensmead and Bellville South focusing on illegal street racing resulted in four arrests for drunk driving, two for reckless and negligent driving and one for disobeying a lawful instruction. Officers also issued 504 fines and suspended 52 vehicles for being unroadworthy,” he added.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
