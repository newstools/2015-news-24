I also believe that this matter also revolve[s] around my constitutionally protected right as a woman not be subjected to customs and traditions that infringe on my rights."Beauty's husband died in March 2013 and they have four children. She added that soon after the death of her husband a younger brother to the husband Felix Moyo started behaving differently."I later got to know that he was after my late husband&rsquo;s deceased estate as he started inquiring on what he was going to get from the estate. At some point he indicated to me that my late husband had promised to give him one cow after every 3 years and a lump sum of $3 000," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
