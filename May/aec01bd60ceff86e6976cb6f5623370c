I didn&rsquo;t expect them to be so violent,&rdquo; he said.Travers said he and his friends were walking on Carnelian Drive when three men approached them, asking for their cellphones.&ldquo;They were standing at a nearby embankment and were probably watching us walk for a while before they came at us on the quiet road. The two guys grabbed my two friends and searched them before they came for my phone.&rdquo;Travers said that one of the men grabbed his BlackBerry Z3 and they both began to struggle for the phone.&ldquo;He looked me in my eye and stabbed me. I felt it graze my head but with his second strike the knife was in my head.&rdquo;Travers said he felt dizzy and let go of the phone. He said the man then pulled the knife out of his head, grabbed his phone and ran off.&ldquo;It was so scary. The neighbours rushed me to Northdale Hospital where the doctors said I was lucky that the knife did not damage my skull,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I am still so traumatised. I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;He received six stitches to his head.&ldquo;We are so worried for Travers because he starts examinations next Monday. He lost a lot of blood and is still quite dizzy at times,&rdquo; said Travers&rsquo;s sister, who asked not to be named.Police had not responded to a request for comment by the time of going to press24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
