	     Pietermaritzburg - A 31-year old man has been taken to hospital in a serious condition after being mauled by a dog in Pietermaritzburg, paramedics said. Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha said paramedics were called to Deodar Road in the Pietermaritzburg’s Eastwood suburb on Monday morning where they found the man lying on the pavement “A report from the scene indicates that the man was walking past the premises when the dog attacked him, however, exact detail to the cause off the attack is still speculative and will remain a subject for police investigation.” Botha said that according to paramedics at the scene the man’s arm was “very shredded” and he had sustained bite marks all over him. “Part of the ear was gone,” he said.
