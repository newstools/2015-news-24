Open Gate Special School teacher Sibusiso Clement Majozi had complained to Sadtu and the department.When contacted by The Witness, school principal Lorraine Shamase said she had &ldquo;no idea&rdquo; what we were referring to and directed us to the Education Department. Department of Education KZN spokesperson Sihle Mlotshwa confirmed receiving Majozi&rsquo;s complaint and said they will &ldquo;advise the principal to allow the educator to practise his religion&rdquo;.&ldquo;The department is going to engage with the principal to make timetable arrangements with the educator to ensure that he makes up for an hour lost. We are a government department that respects freedom of religion,&rdquo; said Mlotshwa. Majozi said he met with Shamase almost two years ago to discuss his leave of absence for one hour on Fridays. He claims the school principal initially allowed him to leave the school for prayer provided he &ldquo;paid back the time&rdquo; in the week. &ldquo;I agreed that I would pay back my time. I had no problem with that. However after a month or so I was called back and told that I could not leave the school at all for my prayers on Friday. I was advised by the principal that it was against the department policies,&rdquo; said Majozi. &ldquo;I am a human being too and I have a right to pray. Nobody should deny my rights,&rdquo; he said24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
