The body of a young lady found on the mountain slopes above Kalk Bay last week is yet to be identified. The discovery led to a media frenzy last week amid fears that the body found is that of Michaela Adriaanse (16), who went missing last week. According to a police report released late on Friday 20 March, Adriaanse from Hanover Park went missing on Thursday 19 March. The discovery of the body led many to deduce it belongs to Adriaanse, but according to Muizenberg police spokesperson Captain Stephen Knapp, the body has not yet been identified. He explains due to the extent of the injuries, the family has not been allowed to see the body and officers will now have to wait for the results of the DNA tests to determine if it is Adriaanse. Police have also arrested a 36-year-old Steenberg man in connection with the case.
