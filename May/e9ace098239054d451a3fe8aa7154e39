If he finds there are sufficient grounds, a trial will be brought."In early May, Tchangari's organisation published a report that criticised Niger's authorities after the evacuation of some 25 000 Lake Chad residents over fears of new Islamist attacks, following a deadly assault in late April.At the time, Tchangari said thousands of Lake Chad residents - including women, children and elderly - "walked for more than 50km" until they reached safety."No preparations were in place to welcome... or support them," he said.The call for Lake Chad residents to evacuate came a week after a cross-border assault by Nigerian-based Boko Haram insurgents on the island of Karamga that left at least 74 people dead.It was Niger's heaviest loss since it joined a regional offensive against the militants, whose six-year insurgency has claimed some 13 000 lives and displaced about 1.5 million peopleIn a statement Tuesday, Amnesty International called on Niger to free Tchangari "immediately", saying: "The fight against Boko Haram must not serve as a pretext to violate free speech." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
