Our instructions are therefore to approach the Labour Court for a declaratory order, inter alia, to declare our clients to be permanent employees of the commission,&rdquo; the letter reads.According to Purdon&rsquo;s letter, the interpreters had a meeting with the CCMA early in May, but were told that their grievances would only be addressed in September.A statement issued by the CCMA in response to questions posed by News24 read: &ldquo;As one of the custodians of the Labour Relations Act, the CCMA is a model employer and has accordingly taken the necessary steps to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the Labour Relations Act. "As things stand, the CCMA is in the final stages of implementing a project to employ the required compliment of its interpreters on a full-time basis while still maintaining a smaller group of part-time interpreters within the parameters of the law.&rdquo;The statement did not say how many of the interpreters would be employed or when they expected the process to be completed.The CCMA was still in the process of determining what grade an interpreter should be employed at.&ldquo;CCMA interpreters presently earn R662.34 per day. The monthly salary of a person appointed to a full-time position will ultimately be dependent on the outcome of the planned job grading exercise.&rdquo;According to the statement CCMA had done everything to ensure that it complied with the law.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
