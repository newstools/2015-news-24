A blunt object was used to attack her.Patel, 28, was arrested six days later. He denied involvement in the murder and said a house robbery had taken place.He said he wanted to be released on bail as he has been psychological and emotionally affected by his wife's death, and needed to see his children.During the bail hearing last Wednesday, an in loco inspection was conducted at the Patel home, apparently to determine whether anyone could have tampered with the property&rsquo;s gate in order to gain entrance.Investigating officer Constable David Nkuna told the court earlier this month that after his wife&rsquo;s murder, Patel went to take a bath at his uncle&rsquo;s house and changed his clothes.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
