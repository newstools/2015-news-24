He also denied that Mbalula had used their company Fortune Air's Boeing 727-200 to fly to the United States."That is nonsense. Our planes did not fly international over the weekend." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
