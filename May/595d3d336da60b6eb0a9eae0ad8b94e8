"China is willing to, and also should, make more contributions to this end."Hua was responding to questions about an AFP interview with the tiny Horn of Africa nation's President Ismail Omar Guelleh, who said that Beijing's presence would be "welcome" and discussions over a military base in his country were "ongoing".China does not have any acknowledged overseas military bases at present, although commercial contracts to build or manage Indian Ocean ports have raised concerns it is seeking to establish a "string of pearls" in the region.Major infrastructure projects Djibouti is already home to Camp Lemonnier, the US military headquarters on the continent, used for covert, anti-terror and other operations in Yemen and in Somalia and elsewhere across Africa.France and Japan also have bases in the port, a former French colony that guards the entrance to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, and which has been used by European and other international navies as a base in the fight against piracy from neighbouring Somalia.China is already financing several major infrastructure projects in Djibouti estimated to total more than $9bn, including improved ports, airports and railway lines to landlocked Ethiopia."France's presence is old, and the Americans found that the position of Djibouti could help in the fight against terrorism in the region," Guelleh said in last week's interview."The Japanese want to protect themselves from piracy - and now the Chinese also want to protect their interests, and they are welcome," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
