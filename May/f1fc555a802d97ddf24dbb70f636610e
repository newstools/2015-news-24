According to the report, residents in and around the Midlands province had spent sleepless nights while police launched an operation which led to the serial killer&rsquo;s arrest. &nbsp; Nduna was nabbed from a local nightclub in Mvuma, the report said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
