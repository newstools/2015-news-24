Adam Wakefield Magistrates are demanding a single pay structure for the judiciary: one that would have their salaries and benefits put on the same sliding scale as those of judges.

Eyewitness News reports that the state queried differences in statements made by Nathaniel Katlego Mpoku, the man accused of kidnapping and killing the Reiger Park toddler.&nbsp; Van Wyk disappeared on August 6 last year and was found three days later by a passer-by at a mine dump in Reiger Park. The State told the Johannesburg High Court, sitting at the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court, that Mpoku changed his account of how Van Wyk had apparently followed him, asking for biscuits, before the toddler disappeared, the broadcaster reported. It was put to Mpoku that instead of chasing the boy away, he kidnapped and killed the child. Mpoku denies the charge. On Thursday, Mpoku told the court that he had left Van Wyk in a street where other boys were playing near the soccer field where the three-year-old was last seen. He said this happened around 13:30. However, a witness on Monday told the court that they saw the toddler with Mpoku in the vicinity of the field at around 16:30. Earlier this week, forensic pathologist Dr Akmal Khan told the court that Van Wyk died as a result of strangulation and being burnt alive, with both events either happening simultaneously or very close to one another.&nbsp; Khan said that tests conducted on a rock found on the child's body, and on a jersey thought to have been used to strangle him, did not match Mpoku's DNA.&nbsp;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
