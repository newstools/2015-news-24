The minister of sport will be issuing a press statement, so once the statement has been issued you will have a better understanding of what you are talking about,&rdquo; he said.Jordaan, who repeatedly looked at his watch during the press conference, is believed to be flying out to Zurich later on Thursday, where he will be attending a FIFA conference as the head of the South African Football Association.Mandela Bay Director of Communications, Roland Williams, remarked that &ldquo;some of us have flights to catch&rdquo;.When asked if he was indeed flying to Zurich, Jordaan said: &ldquo;Is it the first time that a mayor attends a meeting then flies?"Even if it is the first time, I know of ministers, members of Parliament and mayors, not just in this city all over the country and all over the world. If I am the first, please tell me... I want to enter it into the Guinness Book of World Records,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
