The provincial Department of Public Works is responsible for the payment of bulk services to&nbsp;these no-fee schools and it has failed to make timely payments.According to Public Works MEC Sam Mashinini, the department has a&nbsp;shortfall of more than R265m for the&nbsp;payment of municipal services across the province. Maditse Seoke, head of the Free State public works department, told News24 he was not aware of the electricity supply to&nbsp;the schools being cut.&ldquo;Until now the municipalities have&nbsp;been patient, because they knew the bills will be paid eventually. But their&nbsp;own debt is running into the millions, with the result that they are under&nbsp;pressure to get the money owed to them,&rdquo; said Leonie Kleynhans, MPL and member of the portfolio committee on&nbsp;public works.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
