Tattoos were visible on various parts of his body.Security into court room 1 was tight and police officials asked people to identify themselves before entering.A large contingent of police officers and correctional services officials surrounded the square dock and kept a close eye on the group.Plato said these convictions should be used as a model case of how to ensure gangsters were removed from the streets and held responsible for crimes.&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s successes are the result of a collaborative and specialised approach which, if institutionalised in the form of specialist gang and drug units, can result in even more successful convictions,&rdquo; he said.The case was postponed until Tuesday.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
