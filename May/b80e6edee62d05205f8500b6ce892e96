We have set aside R200 million for the electrification of informal settlements in 2015-2016, with R200 million set aside for 2016-2017,&rdquo; Makhubo said.He tabled a R52-billion budget. From this, R42 billion would go towards operating expenditure and R10 billion to capital expenditure.Makhubo announced some tariff increases and some good news for the poor, who would benefit from the city&rsquo;s programmes set to bring them some relief.Property rates were going up by 6%. Makhubo said this was &ldquo;within the South African Reserve Bank inflation target range&rdquo;.&ldquo;The proposed average tariff increase for electricity is 12.19% in line with the National Energy Regulator/Eskom-proposed tariff increase. The message we want to convey to our residents is the less electricity consumers use, the less they pay.&ldquo;The proposed water and sewerage tariff increase is 14% from the 2015-2016 financial year. This is, largely, a &lsquo;pass-through cost&rsquo;. For the 2015-2016 financial year, the city will increase refuse removal services by 8% for domestic, businesses and commercial customers.&rdquo;There is some relief though for those who cannot afford to pay at all.&ldquo;Within the context of the economic environment we are currently facing I would like to highlight aspects of our tariffs and rebates that are designed to provide relief to the residents of Johannesburg,&rdquo; he said.Residents who qualify were urged to apply for assistance through the city&rsquo;s extended social package, which assists poverty stricken and vulnerable households and individuals.
