System TWENTY three people suspected of being part of a drug syndicate were arrested by KwaZulu-Natal cops this week. In an integrated operation by the KwaDukuza Cluster, Umhlali SAPS, Chatsworth Crime Intelligence, Shongweni K9 Unit and the Hawks, a recovery of heroin with an estimated street value of R500 000 was also made. Provincial police spokesperson Major Thulani Zwane said the integrated­ operation resulted in the arrest of 23 suspects, aged between 19 and 36. Police made the breakthrough following investigations into suspicious activities at a house in Ballito believed to be used for drug-related activities. “On arrival at the house police found six female occupants who were locked inside the house as well as a number of empty [heroin] straws and five sealing machines. However, no drugs were found.” He said the occupants were taken in for questioning and intensive investigations led them to a second house in La Lucia where they found 23 occupants inside. “Police recovered 20 000 straws filled with heroin as well as six sealers in the second house. All 23 suspects were arrested and charged with dealing in drugs. They appeared at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday.” KwaZulu-Natal Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Mmamonnye Ngobeni, congratulated the multi-disciplinary team from the SAPS: “We have had numerous breakthroughs such as this in various parts of the province recently and our police officers are breaking the back of drug syndicates in the province. We plead with communities to work with us in closing down drug dens and report drug lords who recruit youngsters for drug trading.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
