Some are&nbsp;HIV positive.Some of the children were found in rubbish bags, in dustbins, on rubbish dumps, in shebeens or at taxi ranks. Others were left at the hospital after delivery, abandoned with strangers, or left without care for extended periods.Salvation Army Southern Africa spokesperson Carin Holmes said they were thankful that nobody was physically hurt, but were&nbsp;disturbed by the&nbsp;trauma&nbsp;those at the home had been put through.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to comprehend the inhumanity of people who strike a place of caring for helpless little babies who have been abandoned."Many of the items stolen are important for the effective operation of the home. Other items, such as wedding rings, have personal significance for the staff who give sacrificially of themselves to care for the babies.&rdquo;Members of the public who wanted&nbsp;to help could contact the home or visit the Salvation Army website for donation details.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
