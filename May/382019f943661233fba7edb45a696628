Aruna Shanbaug suffered brain damage and was in a vegetative state after she was raped and strangled by a hospital worker in 1973. Pravin Bangar, medical superintendent at Mumbai's King Edward Memorial Hospital, said Shanbaug had been diagnosed with pneumonia and had been on a life support system for the past few days. Shanbaug's case sparked a debate over India's euthanasia laws after a Mumbai lawyer petitioned the courts to stop force-feeding her through a tube so her suffering would not be prolonged. The case was opposed by nurses at the hospital who took turns taking care of her for more than four decades. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
