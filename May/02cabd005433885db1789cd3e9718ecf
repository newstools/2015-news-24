"We found it outside the shop by itself around 15 months ago. It was a baby and we took it him inside and we took him home sometimes as well, so it had a chance at life," says Malek Bouzouane, who with colleague Badr Djawhari rescued the bird. The bird, named Poupou, has since become an attraction at the shop found at the Constantia Centre off Jim Fouche Road in Constantia Park, with customers often returning to just see the little bird, who belongs to the mossie or Cape sparrow species. Bouzouane said he named him Poupou, a term he would normally use for a dog. Since Poupou took residence in the shop, it refuses to leave. If it sits atop Malek's shoulder - which it does regularly - and he walks out the door, Poupou flies away back into the safety of the shop. It is no stranger to sitting on newcomers' shoulders once introduced, as this writer pleasantly found out during his visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poupou the mossie gets to know News24 reporter Adam Wakefield. (News24)"It doesn't like bird seed. It eats banana, bread, rice, chicken, it's a crazy bird. It also likes egg," Malek says. "Sometimes the customers just come to see the bird. They bring their family, wives, kids to see the bird. Sometimes people don't believe them and they take pictures and videos of the bird." Badr got another bird so Poupou had a friend but the two do not like each other. The new bird is in a cage, unlike Poupou. &nbsp; Asked if he likes having Poupou in the shop, Malek says: "Of course, I'm not married.
