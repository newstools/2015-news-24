But there are also calls for legal action to be taken against former partners who leak photos in Zimbabwe."So if we have these men, taking these pictures and circulating them on social media networks, why is legal action not being taken against them?" asked popular entertainment website Zimbojam.Popular Harare blogger @CynicHarare tweeted: "Last week they were on that 'Miss Zim is ugly'. But now salivating &amp; demanding to see her nudes."The Chronicle said on Tuesday: "Kachote might set a new record for the shortest reign as Miss World Zimbabwe." &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
