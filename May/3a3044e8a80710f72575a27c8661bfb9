	     Johannesburg - Pensioners over 70 who own a house worth R2m or less will receive a 100% rebate on their property rates from the City of Johannesburg, financial mayoral committee member Geoffrey Makhubo said on Tuesday. The price of electricity would however increase by 12.19%, he said while delivering the city's budget speech in Sandton. He said the rebates were designed to provide relief to residents. Pensioners who earned less than R7 850 a month would also get a 100% rebate. Those earning more than R7 850, but less than R13 457, would qualify for a 50% rebate. "Child-headed households with property value not exceeding R2m receive 100% rebate on properties," Makhubo said. All households in the city were already receiving six kilolitres of water for free monthly. A subsidised water tariff was in place for those using prepaid meters, he said. There would also be subsidies for sanitation and sewerage tariffs. Makhuba announced increases in property, electricity and other essential services rates. The electricity price increase was in line with the National Energy Regulator of SA and Eskom's proposed increases. "The message we want to convey to our residents is: the less electricity consumers use, the less they pay." The cost of waste removal services would increase by 8%, and that of water, sewerage and sanitation services by 14%. Property rates would increase by 6%, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
