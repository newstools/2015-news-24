THE case of Bollywood bad boy Salman Khan on a charge of reckless motoring resulting in a fatality and several injuries, brought about a strange riposte from his defence team people shouldn t sleep on pavements.That the driver was inebriated is lost in this case, and the fact that his drunken state caused him to enter into a space, where, even if no one was sleeping on the pavement, the point that the vehicle was in a non-driving zone has been overlooked.Defending the rich and famous (Oscar Pistorius), denies victims and next of kin the right to a fair outcome of a trial.The poor fine slapped on the thespian is another example of bias, and chances are that the famous Dabanngg star will go scot-free with a probable judicial request to pay blood money .A.R.
