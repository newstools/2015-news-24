Umfurudzi Park has not been approached by Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority to take these juvenile elephants," the statement said.Highly sociable animalsThe news will be a disappointment to wildlife lovers who had been hoping that the export of the elephants to China and other destinations would not go ahead. Some animal fans say that since elephants are highly sociable animals, it is cruel to separate the calves from the rest of their families.President Robert Mugabe's government says elephant over-population is causing environmental damage in Hwange and exporting the animals is kinder than killing them. It also insists that the exercise will raise much-needed funds to pay state rangers. A live elephant can fetch up to $60 000 on the international market.Government sources in Zimbabwe told News24 that they believe no more than 27 calves have been captured since late last year, though some conservation groups say the figure is higher.Five elephant calves captured in Hwange in a 2012 operation were sent to Umfurudzi instead of to China in early 2013, Umfurudzi park management confirmed."The calves are all doing very well and have integrated well into a herd of adult animals. The herd is now up to 16 animals and is very settled," the statement said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
