"A group of about twenty persons entered the Goza Primary School premises, went into the principal's office and had a conversation with him. Thereafter, they encountered comrade Desmond Luvhengo who was in class at that time," the Gauteng SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) said in a statement. "Teaching and learning was disrupted as some teachers tried to defend their colleague and others stopped teaching out of shock." Luvhengo is also the chair of the union's Eldorado Park branch. Provincial Sadtu secretary Tseliso Ledimo told News24 that the union was not aware of the reasons behind the alleged attack. "This teacher was placed there from another school in the area to assist, so maybe the people were not happy. But this is why we are asking the department of basic education to investigate the matter," he said. The department could not be immediately reached for comment. The union said Luvhengo had opened a case of assault at the Eldorado police station. Police spokesperson Captain Phillemon Khorombi said: "I can confirm that a case of common assault has been opened and is under investigation."   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
