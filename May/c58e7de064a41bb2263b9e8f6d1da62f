Pygmies were particularly targeted in the attacks, OCHA said. "The Pygmy situation... must be taken very seriously," said Rogatien Kitenge, head of an association that defends the rights of Pygmies, warning the hunter-gatherer Pygmies were being "hunted down like game".The UN peacekeeping mission in DR Congo, Monusco, said on Wednesday that Pygmy militia had repeatedly attacked Luba villages. Since colonial times, the Pygmies have cohabited uneasily with the Bantus, who are accused of exploiting the Pygmies, paying them meagre wages - or with alcohol and cigarettes - and generally treating them as inferior beings. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
