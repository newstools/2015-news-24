Our president is Fabre, and we will not give up."The opposition has said it decided not to challenge the results at Togo's Constitutional Court because it was biased in favour of the president.Gnassingbe's father, Gnassingbe Eyadema, seized power in a coup and ruled with an iron fist for 38 years over the former German- and French-administered colony until his death in 2005.The military then installed his son as leader and elections later that year were marred by allegations of rigging as well as violence which left up to 500 people dead and thousands injured.Gnassingbe then won 2010 elections that the opposition also declared fraudulent but which were judged acceptable by the international community. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
