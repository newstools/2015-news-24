He died instantly.The banner was for his friend Wynand Snyders, 50, who died on Sunday in a similar accident near Lephalale. Snyder&rsquo;s nephew, 16-year-old Jannie, sustained serious injuries. De Lange&rsquo;s wife, Liza, said Snyders&rsquo;s death was a huge blow to her husband.&ldquo;The two were great friends,&rdquo; she said on Wednesday at her Boksburg home.Snyders coached De Lange&rsquo;s daughter, Mia, 14, in professional shooting.De Lange texted his wife on Tuesday to say that he was quickly going for a spin in an aircraft.He made a banner for the flight with the words &ldquo;Wynand RIP&rdquo; on it.&ldquo;We believe something happened with the banner that caused the engine to fail,&rdquo; said his wife Liza.&lsquo;It all happened so fast&rsquo;She said her husband had more than five years&rsquo; experience with the microlight aircraft.De Lange&rsquo;s family has been left in shock.&ldquo;It all happened so fast. He sent an SMS shortly before he went flying and said I must tell the children he loves them.&ldquo;He was the best father, he was absolutely wonderful with the children. He was a good man... a wonderful man.&rdquo;Liza said her husband lived for flying and had wanted to be an air force pilot but his eyes were too weak.&ldquo;If he could choose a way to die, it would have been that way.&rdquo;Aviation authorities are investigating both accidents.Meanwhile, Snyders&rsquo;s nephew Jannie is doing well, his sister Magda told Netwerk24. He could breathe on his own now, she said.&ldquo;Jannie is responding well. He&rsquo;s opening his eyes on his own but he&rsquo;s still not out of danger yet. He can have a setback at any time.&rdquo;24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
