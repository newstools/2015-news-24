He thinks he is the voice of reason when it comes to African history He later told City Press that the Homo naledi find confirmed &ldquo;pseudo science that Africans are descendents of baboons&rdquo;.&nbsp; He insisted that it was his and the Kara Institute&rsquo;s position, and not the position of the ANC.&nbsp; Earlier yesterday, President Jacob Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa had praised the discovery.&nbsp; The president said from Tuynhuys at Parliament hat he was very excited about the discovery and was proud that it had happened in South Africa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our country is truly the cradle of mankind,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Motshekga insisted that he values scientific work.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the African story can not only be told with stones and skulls. There is ancient literature about the universe that offers a broader perspective.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to him, the Kara Heritage Institute had done a lot of research. A lot of &ldquo;ancient knowledge&rdquo; was being suppressed.&nbsp; Motshekga later replied by text message: &ldquo;Palaeontology seeks to establish that humanity evolved from apes.This is based on the Western materialist world view which says &lsquo;the world is all that is&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to Motshekga this approach is one-sided and misleading and it leaves out of account the Kemetic (African) literature showing that the material universe and humanity evolved from and are made of the same substance with the creator.&nbsp; &ldquo;This idea is contained in the Kemetic law of correspondence which says &lsquo;As above, so below&rsquo;. A human being is both spiritual and material and pre-exists its material shape. Attempts to link human ancestors and apes are a futile exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Motshekga said a total paradigm shift was needed to educate people.&nbsp; He also referred to the ancient text of Egyptian philosopher Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus, The Divine Pymander.&nbsp; The document has been hailed as the book of all books in which the true knowledge of God and nature was contained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It provides a different view on how we understand evolution,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I challenge them [scientists] to a debate on this.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Democratic Alliance praised the scientists for the discovery and labelled it as a great achievement for South Africa. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
