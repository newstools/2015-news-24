This has affected power supply for both Zimbabwe and Zambia.Energy Minister Samuel Undenge launched the solar energy policy in Harare earlier on Wednesday.&nbsp;The main component of the policy is the discontinuation of electric water heaters, known as geysers, which will be replaced with solar powered ones.Udenge said in an interview with dpa that Zesa would import solar heaters from China."We want this to be easy on our customers, so Zesa will then install the geysers and then customers pay for the geysers over a maximum period of three years," he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
