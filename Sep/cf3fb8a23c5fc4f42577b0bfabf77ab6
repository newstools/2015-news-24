Durban â€“ A man who was on the police's
wanted list for most of this year has finally been nabbed. The man, who was wanted for a string of
crimes including housebreaking and theft, was arrested after a tip off. Verulam SAPS communications officer,
Warrant Officer Mark Prakasim said Leon Naidoo, 30, was tracked to a shelter in
Durban. "A team was gathered, went to the
shelter, staked out the place for about three hours and arrested the suspect
when he arrived," he said. Naidoo is currently being held at the
Westville Prison. Prakasim said Naidoo allegedly stole R100
000 worth of jewellery and three firearms earlier this year. He said Naidoo had also been linked to
similar crimes in Durban North, Verulam, Tongaat and Stanger. He added that
Naidoo had been previously convicted for robbery, housebreaking and possession
of heroin.
