	     Johannesburg - A domestic worker and her husband were arrested for a farm attack in Limpopo in which a woman was killed and locked in a walk-in safe with her husband, police said on Monday. The couple were employees on the farm and were arrested over the weekend, Colonel Ronel Otto said. Two other suspects were arrested in Diepkloof, Soweto. Petro Res, 60, her husband Bruno, 70, and their friend Marie Barnard, were attacked in their home on the Motlopi Lodge game farm on Friday, September 18. Bruno Res was shot in the arm when he could not remember the code to a smaller safe which was in the walk-in-safe. Petro was shot in the head. The three were locked into the walk-in safe, where they spent about 16 hours before neighbours came to investigate and heard their cries for help. The killers stole five firearms, including hunting rifles. Police were searching for five more people wanted in connection with the crime. The four arrested would appear in the Thabazimbi Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
