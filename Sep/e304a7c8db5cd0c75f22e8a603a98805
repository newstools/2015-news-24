It said two civilians and four assailants had died in the attack, which culminated in a firefight lasting more than two hours.CEPADHO blamed the attack on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group active near Beni.Local activists say the group has been responsible for a spate of overnight massacres of civilians since last October that have killed more than 400 people, despite operations against it by Congolese forces and UN peacekeepers.Mak Hazukay, deputy spokesperson for the army's operations in the area, denied that any Congolese soldiers had been killed in the attack. He said one soldier was wounded while six unidentified assailants were killed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
