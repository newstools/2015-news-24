Nompendulo NgubaneBECAUSE their school fees have not been paid 25-year-old twins from Imbali Unit 18 have been refused their matric certificates. The twins - Nombuso and Busisiwe Mpulo - were enrolled at Esiqongweni Secondary School in Imbali Unit 13 in 2013, but dropped out after losing their parents. Nombuso said they were told they cannot get their certificates without paying the R200 school fees they owe. We have to pay R400, which we don t have. The problem is that we can t look for a job. Whenever we try they ask for our matric certificate. We have tried to get our matric certificate on numerous occasions, but we have now given up trying, said Nobuhle.The principal at the time, but now retired, Raphael Mpulo, said he doesn t remember the twins coming to the school in 2013 and 2014. I was at the school at the time, but I don t remember seeing them at the school for their matric certificates. Pupils who are not allowed to get their certificate are those who don t come with proof that they are orphans. The school also has records of pupils who are orphans so it should not be a problem to release their results if there is proof, said the former principal. The Mpulo family live in a five-room mud house. They fetch water from the neighbours because they don t have a tap. Spokesperson for KZN Department of Education, Muzi Mahlambi, said the school doesn t have the right to withhold pupils certificates or results. In this country no school is allowed to withhold the results of pupils due to none payment. We always remind schools that doing this is not allowed. Since we know about the matter they must go to the school and let them know that we are aware of the matter, as the department. The school must release the results, if that fails we will send officials to the school to intervene, said Mahlambi24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
