Using multiple variables which can be adjusted to your liking, the Living Wage Calculator aggregates a total monthly wage needed for your domestic worker to support her household based on her family&rsquo;s specific circumstances. Some of these adjustable variables include: the number of dependents in the household; transport costs; healthcare; housing; education, and four others, all of which contribute to calculating a "fair wage" for that household either per day, per week, or per month. The figure isn't a mandatory gauge for what people should be paying. Rather, it is just an indication of exactly what is needed in South Africa to provide the bare necessities for any family, and how the recommended wages set for domestic workers falls well below that.
