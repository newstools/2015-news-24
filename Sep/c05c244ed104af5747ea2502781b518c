Nokulunga Ngobese ON a mission to decrease the mortality rate of women who die during child birth, the KZN MEC for Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, urges the public to join forces with the department in discouraging teenage pregnancy because of the risks associated with it. According to recent findings, a number of women are dying of blood loss during caesarean deliveries, especially in KZN. Dhlomo, currently visiting health districts across the province­ to spread the word, said in 2009 the national Department of Health introduced a campaign called “Accelerate Reduction of Maternal and Child Morbidity and Mortality in Africa”, which was officially launched in 2013. In a media statement issued by the department, women under the age of 18 run the risk of losing their lives and their child during childbirth especially if the baby weighs more than three kilograms. The department has trained 227 people who will specialise in training people in midwifery in order to reduce the risk associated with birth complications, 11 obstetric ambulances have been deployed in 11 districts across the province and 26 maternity waiting areas have been established in hospitals and clinics. “We encourage young people to abstain from engaging in sexual activities. “Those who cannot are urged to use dual protection whereby males ensure they are circumcised and use condoms, while women can prevent unplanned pregnancies through various prevention methods. “This will not only prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, it also prevents the spread of HIV, Aids and unplanned pregnancies. “By getting pregnant at an early age, young women put their lives at risk,” said Dhlomo   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
