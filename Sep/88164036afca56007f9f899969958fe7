Not only does overcrowding and the lack of sufficient sanitary facilities affect inmates and staff at the Pollsmoor Prison, but has for some time being an issue of national concern,&rdquo; the statement said.Popcru said ablution facilities were minimal and overcrowding saw inmates and staff falling victim to diseases associated with &ldquo;such inhumane conditions&rdquo;.&ldquo;Our view is that prisons should not become a death sentence, but a platform with which those who have been found to have offended are rehabilitated so they could later be integrated and play a meaningful role in our society.&rdquo; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
