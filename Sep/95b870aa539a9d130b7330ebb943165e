What are you happy about?"BDS campaigner Muhammad Desai slammed the supermarket and the superstar."Over 551 Palestinian children under 16 were killed in six weeks a year ago. Woolworths and Pharell were silent," he said."Those who have gone back to Woolworths: we know who you are and where you live. Come back home."Desai on Monday told News24 that the #BoycottWoolworths campaign, part of the larger BDS movement, was far bigger than just a local organisation hoping to make a noise."The boycott is not a malicious boycott or punitive. It&rsquo;s simply aimed at how we can get Israel to end its occupation according to international law," he said."There are various supermarket chains, pension funds and companies around the world which have already divested from Israel."Over 17 EU union countries have issued warnings against companies doing business in Palestine occupied territories."WATCH: Scenes from the #PharrellProtest in Cape Town as hundreds gathered outside GrandWest Casino to protest against Woolworths and the US musician.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
