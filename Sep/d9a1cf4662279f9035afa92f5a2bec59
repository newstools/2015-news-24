The public must come with information and once we have that information, it is very easy for us [to make arrests]," he said.A total of 36 people have been arrested by police in nine cop killing cases dating back to March this year.Nkosi-Malobane said the community's assistance was crucial in cases where police officers were killed."The reason why we are successful in arresting these people, it is the community that has come forward, that has given us information and in most cases they have asked for us to protect their identity," she said."We will make sure that none of them are exposed to any danger."The briefing took place shortly after two police officers were shot and killed in Dobsonville, Soweto. The first officer was killed on the scene while the second died later in hospital.It appeared the two officers were targeted by a large gang - travelling in two cars - who chased after the officers. Case dockets in the two police officers' possession were taken by the gang after the shooting.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
