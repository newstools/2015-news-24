On the farm there are 100 females and about 400 piglets.Although there are a few males, most of them have been sold.SPCA manager, Michael Muller, said the man has already received three warnings prior to this incident from the SPCA. In this instance it seems that he ran out of money for feed. We were notified by his vet on Friday afternoon regarding the situation, said Muller. We sent an inspector to the farm and immediately purchased about R2000 worth of food and fed the animals, he said.The SPCA also made a plea for old food from supermarkets on Saturday morning to feed the pigs over the weekend. We managed to collect sufficient food to feed them until Sunday night when some food arrived from the owner, he said. Even if the farmer ran out of money, there is no reason why he could not have collected waste food or by other means to feed the animals . Julia Watson, the SPCA inspector who visited the farm, said the sows were eating the piglets due to distress and that she had notified the Department of Health. Many of the pigs have died too, she said.Watson made several attempts to contact and meet with the owner, but he failed to show up. He s received several warnings and the SPCA now has to take legal action against him, she said.At the time of going to press Watson was in the process of getting legal advice and was con- sulting with the Department of Health24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
