suspects who shot and killed an off duty policeman in Mandalay on Friday night. The constable was attacked as he left a
tavern in Oswell Road at about 21:45, confirmed police spokesperson Lieutenant
Colonel Andre Traut. “He was attacked by four unknown suspects
who robbed him of his firearm. They fled the scene and are yet to be arrested,”
he said. The officer was stationed at Elands Bay
police station, but had been stationed in Nyanga for special duties. Almost 60 officers have been killed this
year alone. President Jacob Zuma earlier this month
said at a commemoration ceremony in Pretoria that police killings were an
attack on the State and must be stopped.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
