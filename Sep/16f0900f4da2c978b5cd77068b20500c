	     Los Angeles - Ever wonder what's really underneath that 5 000-year-old mummy's elaborate wrapping? There will be a rare chance to find out when Mummies: New Secrets From the Tombs opens September 18 at Los Angeles' Natural History Museum. Using state-of-the-art CT scans, exhibition curators have looked right through the wrappings of some two dozen mummies from Egypt and Peru to learn how the ancient people lived and died. Thanks to large, table-top computers placed alongside the mummies and their artefacts, museum visitors will be able to do the same. The show, aimed at providing a greater understanding of ancient peoples and their cultures, is curated by Chicago's Field Museum. The institution has one of the country's largest mummy collections. After leaving Los Angeles in January the mummies will travel to several other cities. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
