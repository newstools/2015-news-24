President Muhammadu Buhari, elected earlier this year on an anti-corruption ticket, has ordered all ministries to put revenues into a single account with the apex bank. A deadline to do so expired on Tuesday night. Asked by AFP on Wednesday whether the deadline had been met, Central Bank of Nigeria spokesperson Mu'azu Ibrahim said: "So far so good. "We are happy with the level of compliance by the ministries, departments and parastatals with the president's directive on a Treasury Single Account (TSA)." Commercial banks are also making efforts to comply with the directive, and no extension to the deadline will be considered, he added. Industry analysts believe the TSA will end the practice of ministries and departments maintaining multiple accounts for government revenues, reducing the chance of fraud and improving monitoring. Buhari has carved out a reputation as a no-nonsense crusader against graft and has vowed to rid the oil-rich country of the menace. Since he came to power in May, he has launched a crackdown on corruption at the state-run oil firm, sacking the entire board and ordering an investigation into its finances. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
