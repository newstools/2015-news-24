The PRS secured five ministries and five secretary of state posts, along with governorships and ambassadorships as part of the agreement.The United Nations last month urged Guinea Bissau's political groups to resume dialogue to end the power struggle, which it worried risked undermining the country's fragile stability.Demonstrations against Vaz have been peaceful and the country's military has vowed to stay out of the political tug-of-war and obey the constitution.The former Portuguese colony has a long history of political instability, having suffered nine coups or attempted coups since 1980.Drug traffickers have taken advantage of the chaos and used the country as a transit point for smuggling cocaine between South America and Europe.Elections last year restored democratic rule and released international aid frozen in the wake of Guinea Bissau's most recent army coup in 2012. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
