"Mitigating measures" had been put in place by the upperclassmen who oversaw the event, such as requiring cadets to wear helmets, academy spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Kasker said in the Times.Video posted on YouTube showed several hundred students vigorously socking each other with pillows during the free-for-all in a courtyard. Pictures of bloodied cadets were also posted on Twitter."West Point applauds the cadets' desire to build esprit and regrets the injuries to our cadets," Kasker said. "We are conducting appropriate investigations into the causes of the injuries."No disciplinary measures have been taken against the cadets and there were no plans to end the yearly brawl, the Times said.Some cadets told the paper that one student who was knocked unconscious had not yet returned to class, however Kasker insisted all cadets were back on duty.West Point has a long history of pillow fights, dating back to at least 1897, the Times added.The military academy's 2013 fight was canceled after a cadet put a lockbox in a pillow case the previous year, it said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
