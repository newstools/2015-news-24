"The way they are being treated now, they are being treated like cattle."Sawiris is the chief executive of Orascom TMT, which operates mobile telephone networks in a number of Middle Eastern and African countries plus Korea as well as underwater communications networks.He also owns an Egyptian television channel.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
