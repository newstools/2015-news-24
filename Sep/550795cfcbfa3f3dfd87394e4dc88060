"This process has already begun and we will leave no stone unturned in defending the integrity of the institution as a component of the three arms of government with a distinct constitutional mandate," said Deputy Speaker Lehlohonolo Masoga on Wednesday. This was after the EFF had successfully barred the ANC from removing Speaker Merriam Ramadwa, who it had suspended, on Tuesday through a court interdict. The ANC wants the Speaker removed from the position, but Ramadwa has defied the party's senior leadership, including Premier Stan Mathabatha. The EFF has previously said it approached the court because the ANC had allegedly violated the legislature's procedure for removing the speaker. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
