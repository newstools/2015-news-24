This was one theory heard from residents in the area, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mondli Gungubele&rsquo;s spokesperson Zweli Dlamini said on Thursday."A group of youngsters started the whole thing with a purpose of fighting nyaope and it became a gangsterism kind of thing," he said.OVL apparently stands for One Vision Lover. Dlamini was speaking after Gungubele visited the area on Thursday and addressed a meeting of school principals.Dlamini said the mayor called for restraint. Three teenage boys, two of them apparently OVL members, have been killed since Sunday. Another suspected gang member, in his late teens, survived an attempt to burn him alive on Thursday.The deaths were apparently due to conflict between residents and the gang.There was a need to bring back a culture of sports, because children were coming home from school, had nothing to do and were being attracted to social ills, Gungubele said. Government, community leaders and teachers had to create an atmosphere of certainty and hope for children.He said community organisations that intended to fight crime needed to ensure the relevant authorities were part of their efforts.He called on police to do more to deal with the lawlessness. Where a crime had been committed, police needed to take action.A task team, led by the member of the mayoral committee for human settlements, had been established to restore peace in the area.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
