They must obtain a permit before going there."Officials at the company that organised the tour were not immediately available for comment.Despite the apparent danger of the area, there are no warning signs along the desert path, and the attack occurred despite an official police representative accompanying the tourist convoy, said tour guide syndicate leader Hassan al-Nahla."Because of this negligence and lack of coordination between the ministry of tourism and ministry of interior, Egypt...will pay the price when this affects tourism," said al-Nahla.While the Islamist insurgency has been largely based in the Sinai Peninsula, attacks have taken place in Cairo and other cities. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
