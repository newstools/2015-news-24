In terms of definite striking off cases, he said about 50% was for corporal punishment."We want to send a strong warning to educators that corporal punishment is not acceptable as a way of disciplining learners."Earlier this month, Eyewitness News reported on two videos that showed a teacher beating students at Randfontein Secondary School, west of Johannesburg.The Gauteng education department told the broadcaster it would investigate allegations of corporal punishment at the school. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
