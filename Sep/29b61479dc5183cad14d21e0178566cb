Libya and whose murders were claimed by the Islamic State group are alive,
Tunisian Foreign Minister Taieb Baccouche said on Monday. Baccouche told private radio station Jawhara FM he had
"irrefutable proof" that Sofiene Chourabi and Nadhir Ktari - who
have been missing in eastern Libya since last September - "are
alive". "We are trying to bring them back to Tunisia,"
he added, declining to give further details. In January, the Libyan branch of ISIS claimed to have
executed the pair. The announcement triggered shock and disbelief in Tunisia
where rallies were held as people demanded proof of their deaths. In April, Libya's internationally recognised government
said five detainees had admitted to killing five local television reporters as
well as the two Tunisians. Chourabi, an investigative journalist and blogger who was
active during Tunisia's 2011 revolution, and photographer Ktari went missing in
the Ajdabiya district of eastern Libya on September 8 2014. Days earlier they had been seized by an armed group near
the northeastern town of Brega but were released before disappearing again. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
