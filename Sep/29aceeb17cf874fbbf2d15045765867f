Spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said three wanted criminals were also arrested. The operation, which involved all law enforcement agencies, targeted dilapidated buildings along Jeppe, Nugget and Kerk streets from 02:00 to 10:00. One of the wanted criminals allegedly shoplifted in 1994, while the other two were wanted for separate drug related cases, one from 2011 and the other from 2012. They would appear in court soon. Minnaar could not confirm if the three were also suspected illegal immigrants. The large group of suspected immigrants would be screened, and if any of them did not have the relevant documentation they would be deported to their respective countries.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
