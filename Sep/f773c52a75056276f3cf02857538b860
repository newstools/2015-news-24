The elements of the case don't warrant a trial."DemonstrationsProsecutor Namatirai Ngwasha said that "on the state's side, there are no changes to the case. We are ready for the trial on Monday".Palmer, an experienced trophy hunter, was hounded on social media over the killing, and went into hiding after demonstrations outside his dental practice.He apologised for killing Cecil, a 13-year-old male renowned for his distinctive black mane, and appeared to blame Bronkhorst for misleading him.The United States has yet to respond to Zimbabwe's request for Palmer to be extradited to face charges.Bronkhorst, who was granted $1 000 bail in the Cecil case, was rearrested this month on separate charges of planning to smuggle 29 sable antelopes - a rare and expensive breed - out of the country and into South Africa.He was also bailed in that case, which will be heard separately. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
