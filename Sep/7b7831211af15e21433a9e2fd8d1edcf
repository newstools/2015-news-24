	     Johannesburg - Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers must always rise above petty provocations and remain professional at all times, the city's public safety department said on Wednesday. "We want to urge both members of the public and JMPD officers to exercise tolerance and respect towards one another," spokesperson Thabo Rangwaga said. "In this respect, we as the department of public safety will continue to insist that officers undergo periodic refresher courses, and this is what the MMC [member of the mayoral committee] has instructed the JMPD to implement." This was following an incident between a motorist, Clive Naidoo, and a JMPD officer, identified by the department as Laurencia Shitlhelana. Naidoo had been stopped for allegedly running a red robot, and chided Shitlhelana for holding him up, adding that as a taxpayer, he pays her salary.  Shitlhelana, filling out his lengthy citation, latched on to this, and was undeterred by his filming, even commenting on his iPhone and saying her father would be pleased to see her on television. When he gave his address in Bloubosrand, she upped the backchat a notch and quipped that he should be embarrassed to live there. The JMPD earlier on Wednesday said it was working on reuniting Naidoo with Shitlhelana who fined him.  Naidoo rocketed to fame after posting a clip of the traffic officer's retorts while he was being fined. JMPD spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar, said they hoped to introduce the officer to the media at a joint press conference with Naidoo on Thursday. Minnaar remained mum on whether her conduct was being investigated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
