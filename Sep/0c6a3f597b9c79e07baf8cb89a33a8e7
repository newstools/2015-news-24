The City Press newspaper reported on a “clash of kings” which started with a reference by King Sigcau to King Goodwill Zwelithini and President Jacob Zuma as “amakhwenkwe” (boys). In a press statement, the Presidency dismissed the article as being without basis. “The newspaper says a mediation team has been established by President Zuma to discuss with the royal family. This is not true. The President has not established such a team.” “There is no mediation between the President and King Sigcau.  The royal family sent a letter of apology last month and the President accepted the apology formally through a letter. The matter was then closed.  There are no plans for any further discussion of the matter,” they wrote. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
