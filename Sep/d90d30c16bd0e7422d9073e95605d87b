More details could result in a security breach, he said.Constitutional Court Judge Edwin Cameron and his law clerks published a scathing report of Pollsmoor Prison earlier this month after visiting the remand centre and the women's centre in April.According to the report, the &ldquo;extent of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, sickness, emaciated physical appearance of the detainees and overall deplorable living conditions were profoundly disturbing".The Correctional Services Act authorises judges to visit prisons. In 2009 the Constitutional Court began a programme of prison visits and monitoring.The report found that the remand centre was "extremely overcrowded at over 300% capacity" with 4 198 inmates.The cells were described as filthy and cramped and in one of the cells the team noted 60 inmates with 24 beds.Plumbing and sanitation was noted as being unacceptable. &nbsp; 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
