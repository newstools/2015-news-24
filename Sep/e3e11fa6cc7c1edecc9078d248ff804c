Amsterdam - The International Criminal Court on Tuesday rejected an application by convicted Congolese war criminal Thomas Lubanga for his early release. There were no important grounds for such a decision, the ICC said in The Hague. Lubanga's defence had argued that he was eligible to be released after serving more than two-thirds of his 14-year sentence. The 54-year-old warlord became the first person to be convicted by the ICC in 2012. He was found guilty of using child soldiers in a conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002 and 2003.
