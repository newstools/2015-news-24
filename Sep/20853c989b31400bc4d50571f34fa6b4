I inherited it from my mother."My mother got the snake from Malawi but now I do not have evidence to prove that because she is no longer alive," Mpinganjira was quoted as saying.The report said Mpinganjira was accused of contravening section 59 (2) (b) of the Parks and Wildlife Act Chapter 20,14 which prohibits removing any animal or any part part of any animal from any land without a permit.The magistrate described the matter as "a bizarre incident" and suggested that Mpinganjira be examined by mental health doctors.Mpinganjira, however, insisted that he did not suffer from any mental disorder.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
