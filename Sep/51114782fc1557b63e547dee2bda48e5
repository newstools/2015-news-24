Potential vaccines moved from the laboratory to the field in record time."It is first and foremost our responsibility as African scientists, as African governments, to actually make sure we are prepared for these sort of emergencies," said Kariuki.On Thursday AESA announced a grant of $70m to support seven African researchers working on issues such as mental health in Zimbabwe, HIV/Aids and tuberculosis in South Africa and malaria in Mali.The World Health Organization has called on countries which are home to 17 priority neglected tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness, rabies and bilharzia, affecting 1.5 billion people worldwide, to invest more in overcoming them.All the diseases are hard to diagnose and have few drugs available for treatment, and there is no vaccine for any of them, Kariuki said.Africa accounts for 15% of the world's population and 25% of its disease burden, but produces only two percent of the world's research, according to the Wellcome Trust, one of the world's largest medical charities.The Trust provided seed money for AESA, along with the Gates Foundation and the British government.The fund is asking African governments to invest one percent of GDP in scientific work.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
