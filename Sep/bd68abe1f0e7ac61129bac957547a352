The al-Bashir matter is not a President Zuma matter. It was government which was brought before the South Gauteng High Court... it is our government which is appealing the judgment," he said.Mthembu accused Maimane of playing the man and not the politics.He said this was because the DA leader was starting to follow the "gutter politics" of the EFF.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
