Cape Town - The son of a "well-known high flyer" in Hanover Park was arrested when metro police apparently found drugs and ammunition inside a pigeon cage. Members of the gang and drug task team had searched the house in Athon Walk on Monday afternoon after a tip-off, according to Cape Town's safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith. He said officials found 14 packets of heroin, with an estimated street value of R175 000, and ammunition inside the cage. A 20-year-old man was arrested on related charges and was set to appear in court soon.
