He said it belonged to his late mother, who, like Mpinganjira, used it in traditional rituals.It is not clear what the man's mother died of - and if it was after being bitten by the snake.Police arrested Mpinganjira and say he will face charges of possessing a snake without a licence. He was shown on TV with the snake coiled familiarly around his neck and shoulders.Black mambas are considered to be southern Africa&rsquo;s most deadly snake. Their neurotoxic venom inflicted through a bite can kill adult humans within hours.&ldquo;These [kinds of] snakes were kept by our mother and since I was helping her in healing processions, our uncles gave them to me when my mother died,&rdquo; Mpinganjira told state TV. The fearsome reptile has now been confiscated by the national parks authorities. But Mpinganjira warns it will find its way back to him.It&rsquo;s not clear what, if any, other charges the diviner may face. In 2013, two women who claimed to have flown to Harare in winnowing baskets were charged with &ldquo;engaging in practices commonly associated with witchcraft&rdquo;.- Health24: Snakebites: What to do24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
