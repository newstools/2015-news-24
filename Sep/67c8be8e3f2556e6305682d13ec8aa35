Johannesburg â€“ Hours after police issued an alert for a missing Pretoria policewoman, she turned up in a hospital. Constable Olga Hlungwane, 32, left her cellphone in her Mamelodi East home and booked herself into Muelmed Hospital without telling anybody, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said on Tuesday. Police and Mamelodi residents began searching for her after she failed to arrive at work for her night shift on Monday. That morning her colleagues had dropped her off at her home in Mantosi Street, Extension 6, which she shares with her two daughters, aged 8 and 15.
