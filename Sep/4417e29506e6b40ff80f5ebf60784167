Duma Ndlovu, the creator of popular SABC2 show Muvango, was speaking to News24 ahead of his John L Dube Memorial Lecture at the University of KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday night. "I think South Africans are starting to realise the hysteria of 1994 is dying down and we need to step up and grab our freedom - or we will look back 100 years from now and feel we have wasted time," he said. Ndlovu said self-reliance and self-respect required more of a focus in the average South African community. "John Dube is famous for being the founding father of the ANC. But he was iconic in his behaviour for his time. He did not wait for anybody. He took half a chance and created a world out of it," he said. Ndlovu especially praised the strong correlation between the ideals of Dube and Steve Biko &ndash; both being disciples of Black Consciousness."I would say these two people should be what the average South African strives for. They influenced our people to fight for an ideal."24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
