We can never thank everyone enough for what has been done for him,&rdquo; said the father.Dakers had just completed his level One Field Guides Association of Southern Africa (FGASA) qualification as a wildlife field guide operator when the accident happened in Thabazimbi, Limpopo.&ldquo;Four of us from the camp went out for the night and on our return to the camp I was asleep in the front passenger seat so I do not recall what happened but it seems that the driver also feel asleep and hit a stationary truck on the side of the road,&rdquo; said Dakers.&ldquo;When I woke up my head was between my legs and I could not move. I was asked by one of the guys if I was okay and I replied I was okay because this is how I felt at that time. I remember someone else shouting &lsquo;Help me&rsquo; and I thought there was obviously someone badly hurt.&rdquo;The collision resulted in severe injuries to Dakers&rsquo;s C4 and C5 vertebrae, leaving him without feeling from his neck down.He was in the intensive care unit (ICU) for six months, almost all of that time connected to a ventilator.His father said Dakers had made progress since his release from the hospital. &ldquo;I believe that in ICU Zak met with God on some level and has matured spiritually because of his situation,&rdquo; he said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
