Bull terriers, Staffordshire Terriers, Pit Bull Terriers and Rottweilers have become sought after prizes for dog fighting syndicates in Africa and locally, according to Project Dog head Quicha Morgado. Speaking to News24, Morgado said she was contacted daily by people who have had their pets stolen. "We have a network and a social media presence and it has gotten to the point that every second day I have people contacting me saying that their pet is missing and asking me to circulate the pictures and the details," she said. "Apparently they [the dogs] are being sold in neighbouring countries for quite of lot of money, and suspected of being placed into dog fighting rings and syndicates.""There have been instances where trucks and vans have been stopped at the border post that are crammed full of dogs that have been kept without food and water, and it becomes a game about US Dollars that they are sold for,&rdquo; she said. Morgado emphasised that pet owners with "bull breeds" should take extra precautions to ensure the safety of their animals. "These dogs need to be behind sturdy fences and away from where they can be seen, like the driveways of homes. People scout for these animals and if home security is lax, then the pets are at risk," she said.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
