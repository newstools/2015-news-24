Wear will be examined every 90 days after the lines and markings have been painted.The SABS will also investigate the other aspects of the SABS specification such as storage environment, viscosity, how the paint is applied, colour, resistance to sagging, drying time, resistance to abrasion and the paint&rsquo;s skid resistance and retro reflectivity."The products from the supplier who provides TCT with paint for road marking are SABS-approved," Herron said."Furthermore, the three companies who are contracted by the City for line marking are also obliged in terms of their contract to use SABS-compliant paint."The SABS will also conduct site sampling in four areas across the metro to find out if the paint was diluted or tampered with. They would also take samples at sites where&nbsp; TCT's road depots are responsible for line marking.The city has spent around R42m on road and line markings over the past financial year, 2014/15.Herron said the investigation will ensure the city received value for money.24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
