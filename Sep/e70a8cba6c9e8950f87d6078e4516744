Cape Town - Three men have been charged with murder after 45-year-old mother Roseline Bosman’s body was found in her bed at the weekend, Eastern Cape police said. The undertaker was found in her home in Booyce Street, Humansdorp, on Saturday morning. “It is alleged that her children went to her room and saw her lying on her bed. They suspected something was wrong and called the police,” said Warrant Officer Basil Seekoei. She had no visible injuries and a post-mortem still had to determine the exact cause of death. Police could not release further details because the investigation was said to be at a sensitive stage. “It is sad. They phoned me about her death that same morning. She was a friendly person,” said her nephew Jason Bosman, who also works at their funeral parlour. A 26-year-old man was arrested in Hankey on Sunday morning. Seekoei said the suspect was found with Bosman’s laptop and ring. His questioning led to the arrest of a 49-year-old man on Monday morning. Seekoei said a third man, 18, was arrested on Monday night. The trio would make separate appearances in the Humansdorp Magistrate’s Court between Tuesday and Thursday. In a statement, provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Celiwe Binta commended officers for their “nifty detective work”.
